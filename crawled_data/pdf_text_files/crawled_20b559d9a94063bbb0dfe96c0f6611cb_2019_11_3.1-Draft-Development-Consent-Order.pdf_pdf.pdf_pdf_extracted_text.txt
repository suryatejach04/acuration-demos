(3) Where the undertaker is not the street authority, the provisions of sections 54 to 106 of the

Construction and maintenance of new or altered means of access 
10.—(1) Those parts of each means of access specified in Part 1 of Schedule 5 (Access) to be 
constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the highway

months from completion and from the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the highway 
authority. 
(2) Those parts of each means of access specified in Part 2 of Schedule 5 (Access) to be 
constructed under this Order and which are not intended to be a public highway must be 
completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority and must be maintained by and at 
the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 months from completion and from the expiry of

(5) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure 
by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence 
or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had 
taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the 
street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic. 
(6) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (5), a court is, in particular, to have regard to 
the following matters— 
(a) the character of the street including the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it; 
(b) the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic; 
(c) the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street; 
(d) whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the 
condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to 
users of the street; and 
(e) where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street 
before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed. 
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant that the undertaker had arranged for a 
competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of that part of the street to which the 
action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given that person proper instructions 
with regard to the maintenance of the street and that those instructions had been carried out.

(3) The undertaker must provide reasonable access for non–motorised users (including 
pedestrians) going to or from premises abutting a street affected by the temporary alteration, 
diversion, prohibition or restriction of a street under this article if there would otherwise be no 
such access. 
(4) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), the undertaker may temporarily alter, 
divert, prohibit the use of or restrict the use of the streets specified in columns (1) and (2) of 
Schedule 6 (temporary prohibition or restriction of the use of streets) to the extent specified in 
column (3) of that Schedule.

to be stopped up) to the extent specified, by reference to the letters and numbers shown on the 
rights of way, streets and access plan, in column (3) of that Schedule. 
 
15 
(2) No street specified in columns (1) and (2) of Schedule 7 (being a street to be stopped up)

under this article shall be entitled to compensation to be determined, in case of dispute, under Part 
1 of the 1961 Act.

operational— 
(a) permit, prohibit or restrict the stopping, parking, waiting, loading or unloading of vehicles on

paragraph (1) of this article has effect as if duly made by, as the case may be— 
(a) the traffic authority in whose area the road is situated as a traffic regulation order under the 
1984 Act; or 
(b) the local authority in whose area the road is situated as an order under section 32 of the 1984 
Act, 
and the instrument by which it is effected is deemed to be a traffic order for the purposes of 
Schedule 7 to the Traffic Management Act 2004 (road traffic contraventions subject to civil 
enforcement)(a). 
(4) In this article— 
(a) subject to sub–paragraph (b) expressions used in this article and in the 1984 Act have the 
same meaning; and 
(b) a “road” means a road that is a public highway maintained by and at the expense of the traffic

(7) If the undertaker is not satisfied that any person giving notice under paragraph (5) is the 
personal representative or relative as that person claims to be, or that the remains in question can 
be identified, the question is to be determined on the application of either party in a summary 
manner by the county court, and the court may make an order specifying who is to remove the

(10) If the undertaker is satisfied that any person giving notice under paragraph (5) is the 
personal representative or relative as that person claims to be and that the remains in question can 
be identified, but that person does not remove the remains, the undertaker must comply with any 
reasonable request that person may make in relation to the removal and re–interment or cremation 
of the remains. 
(11) On the re–interment or cremation of any remains under this article— 
(a) a certificate of re–interment or cremation must be sent by the undertaker to the Registrar

Compulsory acquisition of rights etc. 
23.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the undertaker may acquire such rights over the Order land

temporary use of land pursuant to this article to the same extent as it applies to the compulsory

article 10 (construction and maintenance of new or altered means of access) or article 11 
(temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets) or where a street is stopped up under 
article 12 (stopping up of streets) any statutory undertaker whose apparatus is under, in, on,

sewerage disposal plant.

rights of statutory undertakers in streets) or Part 3 of the 1991 Act applies.

Funding 
34.—(1) The undertaker must not exercise the powers conferred by the provisions referred to 
in paragraph (2) in relation to any land unless it has first put in place either— 
(a) a guarantee and the amount of that guarantee has been approved by the Secretary of State in 
respect of the liabilities of the undertaker to pay compensation under this Order in respect of 
the exercise of the relevant power in relation to that land; or

authorised development or any apparatus used in connection with the authorised 
development; or 
(b) from constituting a danger to persons using the authorised development.

PART 7 
MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL 
Application of landlord and tenant law 
36.—(1) This article applies to— 
(a) any agreement for leasing to any person the whole or any part of the authorised development 
or the right to operate the same; and 
(b) any agreement entered into by the undertaker with any person for the construction, 
maintenance, use or operation of the authorised development, or any part of it, 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) S.I. 1997/1160. 
 
29 
so far as any such agreement relates to the terms on which any land which is the subject of a lease 
granted by or under that agreement is to be provided for that person’s use. 
(2) No enactment or rule of law regulating the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants 
prejudices the operation of any agreement to which this article applies. 
(3) Accordingly, no such enactment or rule of law applies in relation to the rights and 
obligations of the parties to any lease granted by or under any such agreement so as to— 
(a) exclude or in any respect modify any of the rights and obligations of those parties under the 
terms of the lease, whether with respect to the termination of the tenancy or any other matter; 
(b) confer or impose on any such party any right or obligation arising out of or connected with 
anything done or omitted on or in relation to land which is the subject of the lease, in addition 
to any such right or obligation provided for by the terms of the lease; or 
(c) restrict the enforcement (whether by action for damages or otherwise) by any party to the 
lease of any obligation of any other party under the lease. 
Operational land for the purposes of the 1990 Act 
37. Development consent granted by this Order is to be treated as specific planning permission 
for the purposes of section 264(3)(a) of the 1990 Act (cases in which land is to be treated as not 
being operational land). 
Defence to proceedings in respect of statutory nuisance 
38.—(1) Where proceedings are brought under section 82(1) of the Environmental Protection 
Act 1990(a) (summary proceedings by persons aggrieved by statutory nuisances) in relation to a 
nuisance falling within paragraph (g) of section 79(1) of that Act (noise emitted from premises so 
as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance) no order is to be made, and no fine may be imposed, 
under section 82(2) of that Act if the defendant shows that the nuisance— 
(a) relates to premises used by the undertaker for the purposes of or in connection with the 
construction or maintenance of the authorised development and that the nuisance is 
attributable to the carrying out of the authorised development in accordance with a notice 
served under section 60 (control of noise on construction sites), or a consent given under 
section 61 (prior consent for work on construction sites), of the Control of Pollution Act 
1974(b); or 
(b) is a consequence of the construction or maintenance of the authorised development and that it 
cannot reasonably be avoided; or 
(c) is a consequence of the use of the authorised development and that it cannot reasonably be 
avoided. 
(2) Section 61(9) (consent for work on construction site to include statement that it does not of 
itself constitute a defence to proceedings under section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 
1990) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 does not apply where the consent relates to the use of 
premises by the undertaker for the purposes of or in connection with the construction or 
maintenance of the authorised development.

Article 23 
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY 
PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS 
AND IMPOSITION OF NEW RESTRICTIONS 
Compensation enactments 
1. The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory 
purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of 
a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply 
as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land. 
2.—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 
1973(a) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub–paragraph (2). 
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for 
injurious affection under section 7 of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 4(2)— 
(a) for the words “land is acquired or taken” there are substituted the words “a right or restrictive 
covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and 
(b) for the words “acquired or taken from him” there are substituted the words “over which the 
right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”. 
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1961 has 
effect subject to the modification set out in sub–paragraph (2). 
(2) For section 5A (5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act, for (a) and (b) substitute— 
“(a) the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in 
pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act; and 
(b) the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under 
paragraph 13 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 9 of 
Schedule 8 to the Abergelli Gas Fired Generating Station Order 201[X] to acquire 
an interest in the land, and” 
Application of the 1965 Act 
4.—(1) For the purposes of Article 26 only the 1965 Act is subject to the modifications in sub–
paragraph 3(2). 
(2) For section 7 of the 1965 Act (measure of compensation) there is substituted the following 
section— 
“7. In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, 
regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which 
the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the 
acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to 
be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the 
owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by 
this or the special Act.”. 
5. The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in 
various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is 
to say— 
(a) section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey); 
(b) paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity); 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) 1973 c.26. 
 
63 
(c) paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and 
(d) paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land), 
are so modified as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed 
to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive 
covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority. 
6. Section 11 of the 1965 Act (powers of entry) is modified as to secure that, as from the date 
on which the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right it has power, 
exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the 
purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant (which is deemed for this 
purpose to have been created on that date of service of the notice); and sections 12 (penalty for 
unauthorised entry) and 13 (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act are 
modified correspondingly. 
7. Section 20 of the 1965 Act (protection for interests of tenants at will, etc.) applies with the 
modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that 
section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated 
on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent 
(if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by 
the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question. 
8. Section 22 of the 1965 Act (protection of acquiring authority’s possession where by 
inadvertence an estate, right or interest has not been got in) is modified as to enable the acquiring 
authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be 
entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects 
compensation. 
9. For schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute— 
“SCHEDULE 2A 
COUNTER–NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND 
Introduction 
1. This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of 
a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or 
factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act 
as applied by article 24 (application of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) 
Act 1981) in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates. 
2. In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house. 
Counter–notice requiring purchase of land 
3. A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a 
counter–notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, 
building or factory. 
4. A counter–notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days 
beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served. 
Response to counter–notice 
5. On receiving a counter–notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to— 
(a) withdraw the notice to treat, 
(b) accept the counter–notice, or 
(c) refer the counter–notice to the Upper Tribunal. 
 
64 
6. The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 
months beginning with the day on which the counter–notice is served (“the decision 
period”). 
7. If the authority decide to refer the counter–notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do 
so within the decision period. 
8. If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to 
be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end 
of that period. 
9. If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter–notice, the compulsory 
purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s 
interest in the house, building or factory. 
Determination by Upper Tribunal 
10. On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the 
acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would— 
(a) in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, 
building or factory, or 
(b) in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the 
house to which the park or garden belongs. 
11. In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account— 
(a) the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant, 
(b) the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, 
and 
(c) if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other 
purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use 
of the other land. 
12. If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of 
the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must 
determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to 
take. 
13. If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some 
or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to 
treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land. 
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take 
some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the 
period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its 
determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land. 
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must 
pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense 
caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice. 
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

3. This part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations 
between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 
1991 Act. 
4. Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers 
conferred by article 11 (temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets), a utility undertaker 
is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do 
all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or 
desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction 
was in that street. 
5. Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the 
undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement. 
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any 
interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is 
enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus 
must not be removed under this part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to 
maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until 
alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, 
to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub–
paragraphs (2) to (7). 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, 
appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed 
in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that 
requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position 
of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of 
the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to 
remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub–paragraph (3), afford to the utility 
undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other 
land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in 
other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are 
mentioned in sub–paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such 
apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written 
notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours 
to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be 
constructed. 
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this part of this 
Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed 
between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by 
arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration). 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) 1986 c.44. A new section 7 was substituted by section 5 of the Gas Act 1995 (c.45), and was further amended by section 76 
of the Utilities Act 2000 (c.27), Section 48 was amended by paragraph 1 of Schedule 6 to the Gas Act 1995 (c.45). 
 
71 
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or 
constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration), 
and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in 
sub–paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation 
the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to 
be removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule. 
(6) Regardless of anything in sub–paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the 
utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in 
connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, 
that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker 
without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction 
of the utility undertaker. 
(7) Nothing in sub–paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, 
bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filing 
around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the 
apparatus. 
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule, the undertaker 
affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of 
the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those 
facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between 
the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by 
arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration). 
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative 
apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be 
granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in 
question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and 
the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make 
such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as 
appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular 
case. 
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any 
land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, 
any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph (3), 
the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of 
the works to be executed. 
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description 
submitted under sub–paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may 
be made in accordance with sub–paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or 
otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for the securing access to it, and the utility 
undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works. 
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub–paragraph (2) must be made 
within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under 
sub–paragraph (1) are submitted to it. 
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub–paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works 
proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written 
notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the 
apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2). 
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time 
to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new 
plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and 
having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section 
and description. 
 
72 
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub–paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but 
in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably 
practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable 
subsequently and must comply with sub–paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances. 
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a 
utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection 
with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any 
new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are 
referred to in paragraph 6(2). 
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub–paragraph (1) the value of any 
apparatus removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule, that value being calculated 
after removal. 
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule— 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution 
for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, 
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of 
agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration) to be 
necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this 
Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the 
existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount 
which apart from this sub–paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by the 
virtue of sub–paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess. 
(4) For the purposes of sub–paragraph (3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be 
treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus 
where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are 
referred to in paragraph 6(2); and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the 
consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had 
been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub–paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in 
respect of works by virtue of sub–paragraph (1) if the works include the placing of apparatus 
provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to 
confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the 
apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
10.—(1) Subject to sub–paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the 
construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 6(2), any damage is caused to any 
apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its 
intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is 
any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, 
the undertaker must— 
(a) bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such 
damage or restoring the supply; and 
(b) make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, 
damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker, 
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption. 
 
73 
(2) Nothing in sub–paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any 
damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility 
undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents. 
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand 
and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it 
withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any 
proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand. 
11. Nothing in this part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement 
regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaking in respect of any 
apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is 
made.

77 
Apparatus of National Grid in streets subject to temporary prohibition or restriction 
20.—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of any other protection afforded to National Grid 
elsewhere in the Order, where any street is stopped up under article 12 (stopping up of streets), if 
National Grid has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street National Grid will be 
entitled to the same rights in respect of such apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the 
stopping up and the promoter will grant to National Grid, or will procure the granting to the 
National Grid of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to the specified undertaker in respect of 
such apparatus and access to it prior to the stopping up of any such street or highway. 
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary prohibition or restriction under the powers of article 11 
(temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets), National Grid shall be at liberty at all times 
to take all necessary access across any such street and/or to execute and do all such works and 
things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to 
maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street. 
Acquisition of land 
21.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or 
contained in the book of reference to the Order the undertaker must not acquire any land interest 
or apparatus or override any easement or other interest of National Grid otherwise than by 
agreement (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld). 
(2) The undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication 
between the provisions set out in this Schedule relating to the relocation and/or removal of 
apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such 
relocation and/or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, 
agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid as of right or other 
use in relation to the apparatus then the provisions in this Schedule shall prevail. 
(3) Any agreement or consent granted by National Grid under paragraph 24 or any other 
paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, shall not be taken to constitute agreement under sub–
paragraph (1). 
Removal of apparatus 
22.—(1) If, in the exercise of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 21 or in any 
other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus 
is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this part of this Schedule and any right of 
National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land shall not be extinguished until alternative 
apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid 
in accordance with sub–paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive. 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works comprised in the authorised development in, on, 
under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker 
requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid 56 days’ 
advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the 
proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if 
in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid 
reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker shall, subject to sub–paragraph 
(3), afford to National Grid to their satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 23(1) below) the 
necessary facilities and rights for— 
(a) the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker; and 
(b) subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in 
other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are 
mentioned in sub–paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such 
apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from 
the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain 
 
78 
the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed 
save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its 
compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do. 
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this part of this 
Schedule shall be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed 
between National Grid and the undertaker. 
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been 
agreed, and subject to the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to 
in sub–paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into 
operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the 
undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule. 
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus 
23.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule, the undertaker 
affords to National Grid facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the 
undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities 
and rights shall be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the 
undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than 
the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless agreed by 
National Grid. 
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with National Grid 
under sub–paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and 
conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the 
whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be 
removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter 
shall be referred to arbitration under paragraph 31 and, the arbitrator shall make such provision for 
the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be 
reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case. In respect of the 
appointment of an arbitrator under this sub–paragraph (2), article 43 (arbitration) of the Order 
shall apply.

securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus. 
(6) Works executed under sub–paragraphs (1) or (2) shall be executed only in accordance with 
the plan, submitted under sub–paragraph (1) and (2) or as relevant sub–paragraph (4), as amended 
from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with 
such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub–paragraphs (5), (7) and/or 
(8) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for 
securing access to it, and National Grid shall be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of 
those works. 
(7) Where National Grid requires protective works to be carried out either themselves or by the 
undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works shall be carried 
out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised development (or 
any relevant part thereof) to which sub–paragraph (1) applies and National Grid must give 56 
days’ notice of such works from the date of submission of a plan in line with sub–paragraph (1) or 
(2) (except in an emergency). 
(8) If National Grid in accordance with sub–paragraph (5) or (7) and in consequence of the 
works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives 
written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs (1) to (3) and (6) to (7) shall apply 
as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 22(2). 
(9) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the undertaker from submitting at any time or from

Expenses 
26.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker shall pay to 
National Grid on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by 
National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration 
or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus or alternative apparatus 
which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in 
this Schedule including without limitation— 
(a) any costs reasonably incurred or compensation properly paid in connection with the 
acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without 
limitation in the event that National Grid elects to use compulsory purchase powers to acquire 
any necessary rights under paragraph 22(3) all costs incurred as a result of such action; 
(b) in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any 
alternative apparatus; 
(c) the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant 
apparatus; 
(d) the approval of plans; 
(e) the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining 
and renewing permanent protective works; 
(f) the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the 
installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the 
execution of any such works referred to in this Schedule. 
 
82 
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub–paragraph (1) the value of any 
apparatus removed under the provisions of this Schedule and which is not re–used as part of the 
alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal. 
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule— 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution 
for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated, 
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or in default of 
agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration) of the Order to be 
necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of 
this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had 
been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, 
the amount which apart from this sub–paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue 
of sub–paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not 
possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of operations, capacity, dimensions or 
place at the existing depth in which case full costs shall be borne by the undertaker. 
(4) For the purposes of sub–paragraph (3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus shall not be 
treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; 
and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, 
the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole shall be treated as if it also 
had been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub–paragraph would be payable to National Grid in 
respect of works by virtue of sub–paragraph (1) shall, if the works include the placing of apparatus 
provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to 
confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the 
apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
Indemnity 
27.—(1) Subject to sub–paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the 
construction of any works authorised by this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, 
maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or 
in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by 
him) in the course of carrying out such works (including without limitation works carried out by 
the undertaker under this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works), any 
damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of 
which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those 
works) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the 
supply of any goods, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to 
any third party, the undertaker shall— 
(a) bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by National Grid in making good such 
damage or restoring the supply; and 
(b) indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, 
claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in 
consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any 
third party as aforesaid. 
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the 
undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any 
requirement of National Grid as a consequence of the authorised development or under its 
supervision shall not (unless sub–paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under 
 
83 
the provisions of this sub–paragraph (1) where the undertaker fails to carry out and execute the 
works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a 
manner that does not materially accord with the approved plan or as otherwise agreed between the 
undertaker and National Grid. 
(3) Nothing in sub–paragraph (1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of— 
(a) any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of 
National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and 
(b) any authorised development and/or any other works authorised by this Schedule carried out 
by National Grid as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the 
Order pursuant to section 156 of the 2008 Act or under article 7 of the Order subject to the 
proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any works yet to be 
executed and not falling within this sub–section (b) shall be subject to the full terms of this 
Schedule including this paragraph 27 in respect of such new apparatus. 
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and 
no settlement or compromise shall be made, unless payment is required in connection with a 
statutory compensation scheme without first consulting the undertaker and considering their 
representations. 
(5) National Grid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to 
minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this 
paragraph 27 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, National Grid shall provide an 
explanation of how the claim has been minimised. The undertaker shall only be liable under this 
paragraph 27 for claims reasonably incurred by National Grid. 
Enactments and agreements 
28. Nothing in this part of this Schedule shall affect the provisions of any enactment or 
agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any 
apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is 
made. 
Co–operation 
29. National Grid and the undertaker must each use their best endeavours to co–ordinate with 
the other party on the timing and method of execution of any works carried out under the Order 
or this Schedule (including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to paragraph 22(2) and 
paragraphs 24 or 28) in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the 
authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient 
operation of the other party’s operations. 
Access 
30. If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 21(1) or the 
powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the 
undertaker shall provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable 
National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such 
obstruction. 
Arbitration 
31. Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraphs 22(2), 22(4), 23(1), 24 and 25 any 
difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Grid under this Schedule shall, 
unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, be determined by 
arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration) of the Order.

FOR THE PROTECTION OF WESTERN POWER DISTRIBUTION LIMITED 
(SOUTH WALES) PLC 
Application 
32. For the protection of Western Power Distribution Limited (South Wales) plc as referred to 
in this Part 4 of Schedule 11 the following provisions, unless otherwise agreed in writing 
between the undertaker and Western Power Distribution Limited (South Wales) plc, have effect. 
Interpretation 
33. In this Part of this Schedule— 
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable WPD to fulfil its 
statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously; 
“alternative rights” means all and any necessary legal easements, consents, or permissions 
required by WPD in order to permit or authorise a diversion; 
“apparatus” means electric lines or electrical plant as defined in the Electricity Act 1989, 
belonging to or maintained by WPD; 
“diversion” means an alteration to the WPD Network in order to enable or facilitate the

whose registered office is at Avonbank, Feeder Road, Bristol, BS2 0TB; 
“WPD Network” means WPD’s distribution network operated pursuant to its distribution 
licence issued pursuant to section 6 of the 1989 Act; and 
for the avoidance of doubt, all other terms as defined in article 2 (interpretation) of this Order. 
Precedence of 1991 Act in respect of apparatus in streets 
34. This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations 
between the undertaker and WPD are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act. 
No acquisition or extinguishment except by agreement 
35. Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the 
undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement. 
Removal of apparatus 
36.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any 
interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under 
this Part of this Schedule and any right of WPD to maintain that apparatus in that land must not 
be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the 
reasonable satisfaction of WPD. 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, 
appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed 
in that land, it must give to WPD written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and 
section of the work proposed. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed as a consequence of 
the removal of apparatus placed on the land referred to in sub–paragraph (2), WPD must on 
receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its 
 
85 
reasonable endeavours to obtain the alternative rights in other land in which the alternative 
apparatus is to be constructed. 
(4) WPD must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or 
settled by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration) of the Order and after the grant to 
WPD of any alternative rights, proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into 
operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the 
undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of Schedule 11. 
37.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any 
land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are within 3 metres of any 
apparatus, the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 36(2), 
the undertaker must submit to WPD a plan, section and description of the works to be executed. 
For the avoidance of doubt, if any works referred to require any diversion or require WPD to 
obtain any alternative rights, the undertaker must give WPD sufficient notice to obtain any such 
alternative rights and not commence works of the type described unless or until any such 
alternative rights have been obtained. 
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description 
submitted under sub–paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may 
be made in accordance with sub–paragraph (3) by WPD for the alteration or otherwise for the 
protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it. 
(3) Any requirements made by WPD under sub–paragraph (2) must be made within a reasonable 
period beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub–paragraph (1) 
are submitted to it. 
(4) If WPD, in accordance with sub–paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by 
the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the 
undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 32 to 36 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had 
been required by the undertaker under paragraph 36(2). 
(5) Nothing in this paragraph 37 precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from 
time to time, but in no case less than the reasonable period provided for in sub–paragraph (3) 
before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the 
plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this 
paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description. 
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub–paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but 
in that case it must give to WPD notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and 
description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with 
sub–paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. 
Expenses and costs 
38.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to 
WPD the proper and reasonable expenses reasonably incurred by WPD in, or in connection with, 
the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus. 
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of the Schedule is to be 
deducted from any sum payable under sub–paragraph (1), that value being calculated after 
removal. 
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule— 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution 
for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, and the placing 
of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that 
depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not 
determined by arbitration in accordance with article 43 of the Order to be necessary, then, if 
such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule 
 
86 
exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the 
existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount 
which apart from this sub–paragraph would be payable to WPD by virtue of sub–paragraph 
(1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess. 
(4) For the purposes of sub–paragraph (3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be 
treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; 
and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the 
consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had 
been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub–paragraph would be payable to WPD in respect of 
works by virtue of sub–paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided 
in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on 
WPD any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary 
course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
39. The undertaker will indemnify WPD and keep them indemnified in respect of any losses, 
costs, claims or liabilities arising out of, or as a consequence of anything done under this Part of 
this Schedule.

have effect. 
Interpretation 
41. In this Part of this Schedule— 
“accessories” has the same meaning as that set out in section 219 of the Water Industry Act

together with all ancillary actions relating hereto; and 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) 1991 c.56. Section 219 was amended by paragraph 110 of Schedule 17 of the Communications Act 2003 
(b) 1991 c.56. 
 
88 
for the avoidance of doubt, all other terms are as defined in article 2 (interpretation) of this 
Order. 
No acquisition or extinguishment except by agreement 
42.—(1) Subject to sub–paragraph (2), regardless of any provision in this Order or anything 
shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference, the undertaker must not acquire 
any DCC apparatus or its accessories or override or extinguish any easement or other interest of 
DCC or acquire any land or other interest of DCC identified in the book of reference or create 
any new rights over the same otherwise than by agreement with DCC in accordance with the 
provisions of this Schedule. 
(2) Sub–paragraph (1) does not apply to the powers conferred on the undertaker by this Order to 
interfere temporarily with DCC’s rights to access DCC apparatus or accessories but subject always 
to each sub–paragraph of paragraphs 46 and 47 of this Part and to the undertaker giving DCC 28 
days notice of such interference. 
Precedence of the WIA 1991 
43.—(1) Regardless of any provision of this Order and this Part of this Schedule the undertaker 
must comply fully with all provisions of the WIA 1991 in relation to any use of, any connection 
with or any actions or omissions which in any way affect the DCC apparatus and nothing in this 
Order releases the undertaker from the requirement to comply with the provisions of the WIA 
1991 in relation to any use of, any connection with or any actions or omissions which in any way 
affect the DCC apparatus, including without limitation— 
(a) sections 41–44 of the WIA 1991 in respect of water main requisitions; 
(b) section 45 of the WIA 1991 in respect of any connections to a water main;

apparatus. 
(2) The arbitration provisions at article 43, or specified in this Part of Schedule 11 do not apply 
where DCC uses a warrant of entry in accordance with the provisions of the WIA 1991. 
Protection of DCC apparatus 
44.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works that are within the 
clearance area or will, or could reasonably foreseeably affect, any DCC apparatus the removal or 
alteration of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 43(1)(k), the 
undertaker must submit to DCC written notice together with a draft specification. 
(2) DCC must examine the draft specification submitted under sub–paragraph (1) and give its 
written consent or proposed amendments (each not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to the 
draft specification (including the proposed commencement date and anticipated completion date) 
within 28 days from the date of receipt (and in the event of amendments the process in this sub–
paragraph (2) must be repeated where those amendments are not accepted). For the avoidance of 
 
89 
doubt, DCC’s proposed amendments may include such reasonable requirements for the alteration 
(including but not limited to the extension of DCC apparatus) or otherwise for the protection of 
DCC apparatus, or for securing access to it. 
(3) Once approved under sub–paragraph (2), the draft specification is to be the specification and 
the works must be executed only in accordance with the specification and such reasonable 
requirements as may be made in accordance with sub–paragraph (2) and DCC is entitled to watch 
and inspect the execution of those works. 
(4) Nothing in this paragraph 44 precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from 
time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a 
draft specification instead of the draft specification previously submitted, and having done so the 
provisions of this paragraph 44 apply to and in respect of the new draft specification. 
(5) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub–paragraph (1) in a case of emergency 
provided it has complied with paragraph 45 save that the undertaker must comply with sub–
paragraphs (1) and (3) above in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. 
(6) DCC may opt to carry out any temporary and/or protective works specified under sub–
paragraph (2) to DCC apparatus, and if DCC opts to do so it must— 
(a) agree the scope and timings of the works with the undertaker (and the undertaker must not 
unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement to the same); 
(b) provide an invoice together with supporting evidence of the estimated costs of the works on 
the basis of which it must agree with the undertaker the reasonable costs of the works to be 
met by the undertaker; 
(c) following agreement and payment of the costs, DCC must as soon as reasonably practicable 
carry out and complete the works; and 
(d) notify the undertaker immediately in writing upon completion of the temporary and/or 
protective works. 
(7) Only those contractors that satisfy DCC’s reasonable health & safety requirements are 
permitted to make openings into and/or connections with and/or carry out any works on or within 
any public sewer or drain vested in DCC unless otherwise agreed with DCC. 
(8) Only DCC is permitted to make openings into and/or connections with and/or carry out any 
works on or within any public water main vested in DCC unless otherwise agreed with DCC. 
(9) Where DCC apparatus will be affected by the works the undertaker must determine the exact 
location of DCC apparatus prior to any works being carried out by the undertaker and the 
undertaker should contact DCC where trial holes are required. 
(10) Any affected DCC apparatus which is no longer required by DCC but is not removed must 
be transferred to the undertaker by way of a deed of transfer from DCC at the undertaker’s 
expense and on such terms as DCC reasonably requires. 
Suspension of works 
45.—(1) DCC is entitled to instruct the undertaker to suspend the works if in DCC’s 
reasonable opinion, the actions of the undertaker, or those of its contractor(s) or subcontractor(s) 
in carrying out the works, have caused damage to any DCC apparatus and/or are likely to cause 
or result in damage to any DCC apparatus and/or have caused or are likely to cause damage to 
the environment arising as a result of damage to DCC apparatus. In the event of such instruction 
being given by DCC— 
(a) the undertaker must procure that it and its contractor(s) and subcontractor(s) are to forthwith 
suspend or cease the works having due regard to health and safety factors, and discuss and 
agree with DCC the remedial actions required prior to resuming the works; 
(b) the undertaker and DCC must act reasonably and without delay in discussing and agreeing 
any remedial actions required prior to resuming the works; 
(c) DCC must submit to the undertaker within 3 days following the suspension, a written notice 
specifying the reasons for suspending the works; 
 
90 
(d) in the event that DCC fails to supply the written notice within 3 days of suspension, DCC’s 
instruction to suspend the works will be void and the undertaker will be entitled to 
recommence the works; and 
(e) DCC must commence, carry out and complete any remedial works pursuant to sub–paragraph 
(1), as soon as reasonably practicable and DCC must give the undertaker notice immediately 
upon completion of such remedial works and on receipt of such notice the undertaker will be 
entitled to resume the works. 
(2) DCC is entitled to reclaim all reasonable costs of all remedial works undertaken in 
accordance with this paragraph 45. 
(3) DCC must use its reasonable endeavours to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and 
penalties to which this paragraph 45 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, DCC must 
provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised. The undertaker is only liable under 
this paragraph 45 for claims reasonably incurred by DCC. 
46.—(1) In the event that either the undertaker or DCC (for the purpose of this paragraph 46 
“the party” or together “the parties”) wishes to take any action which would impact on the ability 
of the undertaker to carry out the authorised development or DCC to carry out its statutory 
functions, the parties must use reasonable endeavours to cooperate with one another in order to 
align work streams so to minimise or avoid disruption to the other party’s works. In respect of 
the reference to ‘work’ and ‘works’ in this sub–paragraph (1), to the extent that this refers to 
‘work’ or ‘works’ to be undertaken by DCC, the definition of works in paragraph 41 does not 
apply. 
(2) Subject to paragraph 47, differences or disputes arising between the undertaker and DCC 
under this Part of Schedule 11 must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker 
and DCC, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration) of the Order. 
Emergency Works 
47.—(1) The undertaker is permitted to carry out emergency works provided that it first 
notifies DCC of the proposed emergency works. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that 
DCC suffers any loss, cost or damage as a result of the emergency action taken by the undertaker 
without prior notification in accordance with this sub paragraph the indemnity in paragraph 48 is 
to apply. 
(2) DCC must at all times be permitted to carry out any emergency works in relation to its DCC 
apparatus within the Order limits in accordance with Part II, Schedule 6 WIA 1991 (Other rights 
of entry and related powers). 
(3) Emergency works required in order for DCC to fulfil its statutory functions under sub–
paragraph (2) are to take precedence over works to be carried out by the undertaker and, in such 
circumstances, the undertaker must reschedule its works accordingly. 
(4) In respect of the reference to ‘work’ and ‘works’ in this paragraph 47, to the extent that is 
‘work’ or ‘works’ to be undertaken by DCC, the definition of works in paragraph 41 of this Part

(2) Nothing in sub–paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any 
damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of the solar 
operator, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.

proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand. 
(4) The solar operator must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to 
minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which this paragraph 56 applies. If

(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a protected person on behalf of the 
undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a protected person or in accordance with any 
requirement of the protected person or under its supervision will not (unless sub–paragraph (3) 
applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub–paragraph (1) where the 
undertaker fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention in a skilful 
 
98 
and workman like manner or in a manner which does not materially accord with the approved plan

SCHEDULE 12 
Article 42 
PROCEDURE FOR DISCHARGE OF REQUIREMENTS 
Applications made under requirements 
1.—(1) Where an application has been made to the relevant planning authority for any consent, 
agreement or approval required by a requirement (including agreement or approval in respect of 
part of a requirement) included in this Order the relevant planning authority must give notice to 
the undertaker of their decision on the application within a period of eight (8) weeks beginning 
with— 
(a) the day immediately following that on which the application is received by the authority; 
(b) the day immediately following that on which further information has been supplied by the 
undertaker under paragraph 2; or 
(c) such longer period as may be agreed in writing by the undertaker and the relevant planning 
authority. 
(2) Subject to sub–paragraph (3), in the event that the relevant planning authority does not 
determine an application within the period set out in sub–paragraph (1), the relevant planning 
authority is to be taken to have granted all parts of the application (without any condition or 
qualification) at the end of that period. 
(3) Any application made to the relevant planning authority pursuant to sub–paragraph (1) must 
include a statement to confirm whether it is likely that the subject matter of the application will 
give rise to any materially new or materially different environmental effects compared to those in 
the environment statement and if it will then it must be accompanied by information setting out 
what those effects are. 
(4) Where an application has been made to the relevant planning authority for any consent, 
agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order and the relevant planning 
authority does not determine the application within the period set out in sub–paragraph (1)—

matter of such application is likely to give rise to any materially new or materially different 
environmental effects compared to those in the environmental statement; or 
(b) the relevant planning authority determines during the period set out in sub–paragraph (1) that 
it considers that the subject matter of such application will give rise to any materially new or 
materially different environmental effects compared to those in the environmental statement,

planning authority may request such reasonable further information from the undertaker as is 
necessary to enable it to consider the application. 
(2) In the event that the relevant planning authority considers such further information to be 
necessary and the provision governing or requiring the application does not specify that 
consultation with a requirement consultee is required the relevant planning authority must, within 
fourteen (14) days of receipt of the application, notify the undertaker in writing specifying the 
further information required. 
(3) If the provision governing or requiring the application specifies that consultation with a 
requirement consultee is required, the relevant planning authority must issue the consultation to 
the requirement consultee within five business days of receipt of the application, and must notify

one (21) days of receipt of the application. 
(4) In the event that the relevant planning authority does not give notification as specified in 
sub–paragraph (2) or (3) it is to be deemed to have sufficient information to consider the 
application and is not thereafter entitled to request further information without the prior agreement 
of the undertaker. 
(5) Where further information is requested under this paragraph 2 in relation to part only of an 
application, that part is to be treated as separate from the remainder of the application for the 
purposes of calculating time periods in paragraph 1(1)(b), paragraph 1(p4) and paragraph 2. 
Appeals 
3.—(1) The undertaker may appeal in the event that— 
(a) the relevant planning authority refuses an application for any consent, agreement or approval 
required by a requirement included in this Order or grants it subject to conditions; 
(b) the relevant planning authority is deemed to have refused an application pursuant to 
paragraph 1(4); 
(c) on receipt of a request for further information pursuant to paragraph 2 the undertaker 
considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the relevant 
planning authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or 
(d) on receipt of any further information requested, the relevant planning authority notifies the 
undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional information 
which the undertaker considers is not necessary for consideration of the application. 
(2) The appeal process is to be as follows— 
(a) The undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on 
the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant planning authority 
and the requirement consultee (together with the undertaker, these are the “appeal parties”); 
(b) The Secretary of State must appoint a person within twenty (20) business days of receiving 
the appeal documentation and must forthwith notify the appeal parties of the identity of the 
appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for his attention should be sent, 
the date of such notification being the “start date” for the purposes of this sub–paragraph (2); 
(c) The relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee must submit written 
representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within twenty (20) business 
days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to 
each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed 
person; 
(d) The appeal parties must make any counter–submissions to the appointed person within twenty 
(20) business days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub–paragraph (c) above; 
and 
(e) The appointed person must make his decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with reasons, 
as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within thirty (30) business days of the 
deadline for the receipt of counter–submissions pursuant to sub–paragraph (d). 
(f) The appointment of the person pursuant to sub–paragraph (b) may be undertaken by a person 
appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State. 
(3) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to 
enable him to consider the appeal he must, within five (5) business days of his appointment, notify 
the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required. 
(4) Any further information required pursuant to sub–paragraph (3) must be provided by the 
undertaker to the appointed person, the relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee 
on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person 
must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The 
revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the 
 
101 
appointed person within ten (10) business days of the specified date but must otherwise be in 
accordance with the process and time limits set out in sub–paragraph (2)(c)–2(e). 
(5) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may— 
(a) allow or dismiss the appeal, or 
(b) reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant planning authority (whether the appeal 
relates to that part of it or not), 
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to him in the first instance. 
(6) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such 
written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits. 
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have 
been made within the relevant time limits, if it appears to him that there is sufficient material to 
enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case. 
(8) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, 
and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are 
brought by a claim for judicial review. 
(9) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is deemed to be 
an approval for the purpose of Schedule 2 (requirements) as if it had been given by the relevant 
planning authority. The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the 
appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to 
give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed 
person’s determination. 
(10) The appointed person may or may not be a member of the Planning Inspectorate but must 
be a qualified town planner of at least ten (10) years’ experience. 
(11) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub–paragraph (12) requiring the costs of the 
appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the 
appointed person must be met by the undertaker. 
(12) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person 
may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of 
the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on 
which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to the Development Management 
Manual, Section 12 Annex: Award of Costs, or any circular or guidance which may from time to 
time replace it.
