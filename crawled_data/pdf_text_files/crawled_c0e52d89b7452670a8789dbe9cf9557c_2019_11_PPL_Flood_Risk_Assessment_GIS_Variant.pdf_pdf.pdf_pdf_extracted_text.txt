EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Background 
Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd was appointed by Progress Power 
Limited to prepare a site specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) to 
support the Project at the former Eye Airfield located in Eye, Mid 
Suffolk. The FRA was conducted in accordance with the NPPF 
and EN-1 and provides a predominantly qualitative assessment of 
flood risk to the development proposals and the people and 
property elsewhere as a result of the planned development. 
The Project comprises a new gas fuelled Power Generation Plant 
and supporting Electrical Connection and Gas Connection.  
The Power Generation Plant will be sited on the former Eye 
Airfield with existing development to the west, north and east of 
the Power Generation Plant. The Above Ground Installation will 
be sited in the south of the airfield adjacent to Castleton Road. 
The proposed Substation and Sealing End Compound will be 
sited approximately 1 km to the west of the Power Generation 
Plant Site. 
Existing flood 
risk 
The existing Project Site is not considered to be at significant risk 
from any source of flooding, namely fluvial, tidal, groundwater, 
overland flow and artificial sources. The greatest risk of flooding 
to adjacent areas is to land located to the north of the Power 
Generation Plant Site within the former Eye Airfield Industrial 
Estate.  This risk is most likely associated with surface water 
runoff as a result of blocked surface water drains within the 
former airfield, blockages within an existing culverted watercourse 
and lack of capacity in the culverted watercourse. Climate 
change, in particular increased rainfall intensity, could exacerbate 
flooding from these sources. 
Post 
development 
flood risk and 
surface water 
management 
proposals 
If unmitigated, the construction of the Project could increase flood 
risk within the former Eye Airfield Industrial Estate and to 
downstream receptors, including those at existing risk of fluvial 
flooding from the River Dove, associated with an increase in 
surface water runoff from increased impermeable area.  The 
Project may also increase flood risk within the town of Eye to the 
south-east if water is not intercepted by a drainage system and is 
instead allowed to runoff naturally.  
Surface water management for the Project will be designed to 
ensure no increase in surface water runoff for all storms up to the 
1 in 100 year return period storm.  Surface water discharge will 
be limited to the existing greenfield runoff rates to ensure no 
increased risk to people or property elsewhere and allowing for 
the potential effects of climate change over the lifetime of the

development. 
The drainage of the Project Site will need to be confirmed during 
the detailed design of the proposed drainage system, ensuring 
that SUDS principles are applied to the conveyance, attenuation 
and discharge of surface water runoff. The feasibility of infiltration 
will be investigated further during the detailed design of the 
Project, although ground conditions suggest that ground 
permeability is low. If deemed suitable, infiltration of surface water 
runoff will be maximised through the use of combined infiltration 
and attenuation systems, although some discharge from the 
Power Generation Plant Site is still considered likely.   
An open detention pond will be used to store surface water from 
the Power Generation Plant Site during periods of intense rainfall.  
If necessary, surface water will be discharged at an attenuated 
rate to the existing drainage connection located to the north of the 
site adjacent to the Eye Power Station. 
Surface water runoff from the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection will be managed via infiltration into the ground. If 
infiltration does not prove to be a viable option due to ground 
permeability, it is proposed that surface water runoff will be 
discharged to a local drainage ditch at an attenuated rate. 
Through implementation of a robust surface water drainage 
strategy, the development is not predicted to cause an increase 
to flood risk within the site or to people and property elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Objectives 
1.1.1 
Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd was appointed by Progress Power Limited to 
prepare a site specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) to support the 
Project at the former Eye Airfield located in Eye, Mid Suffolk.   
1.1.2 
Review of indicative flood maps available from the Environment Agency 
(EA) website indicates that the Project Site is located within the low risk 
Flood Zone 1. The EA standing advice on flood risk states that a FRA 
will be required to support the planning application for all developments 
that are greater than 1 hectare (ha) located in Flood Zone 1.  Review of 
the development proposals confirms that the Project Site area is 
greater than 1 ha, hence a FRA is required.  
1.1.3 
The FRA will be conducted in accordance with National Planning Policy 
Framework (NPPF), the supporting Technical Guidance to NPPF and 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) to provide a 
predominantly qualitative analysis of flood risk to support the 
Development Consent Order (DCO) application. The assessment will 
include the following: 
 
Confirmation of the sources of flooding which may affect the site;  
 
A predominantly qualitative assessment of the risk of flooding to the 
site and to adjacent sites as a result of development;  
 
Demonstration of how the development and any occupants will be 
kept safe from flooding; 
 
Identification of other measures to reduce flood risk to acceptable 
levels and cause no significant increase in flood risk elsewhere as 
a result of the development; 
 
Proposals for the sustainable management of surface water runoff. 
1.1.4 
The FRA will consider risks for the present day situation and over the 
lifetime of the Project, taking climate change allowances into 
consideration.  
1.2 
Development Proposals 
1.2.1 
The three main elements of the Project comprise: 
 
A new Power Generation Plant - a SCGT gas fired power 
generating station capable of providing up to 299 MW, 
incorporating up to five gas turbine generators (GTG) with up to five 
exhaust gas flue stacks.

 
A new Electrical Connection to export electricity from the Power 
Generation Plant to the National Grid Transmission System. This 
element incorporates a new underground cable circuit connection 
(the Cable), and a new access road (the Access Road), with a 
new road junction off the A140 (the A140 Junction), and a new 
Electrical Connection Compound (ECC) comprising a new 
substation (the Substation) and sealing end compound (the 
Sealing End Compound) (SEC); and 
 
A new gas pipeline connection (referred to as the Gas 
Connection) to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the NTS in the vicinity of the Project Site. This element 
incorporates an Above Ground Installation (AGI) at its southern 
end and a new access road off Potash Lane. 
1.2.2 
The Power Generation Plant, Electrical Connection, and Gas 
Connection are referred to as the Project. All of the land upon which 
the Project will be developed is referred to as the Project Site, and the 
land upon which the Power Generation Plant is situated is referred to 
as the Power Generation Plant Site. 
1.2.3 
Illustrations of the Project, including the layout of the Power Generation 
Plant and route of electrical and gas connections, are provided in 
Appendix A.  A location plan of the Project is also provided in Figure 1 
below.   
1.2.4 
The Power Generation Plant will occupy an area of approximately 7.5 
ha.  Up to 1.9 ha of this area will be impermeable, comprising buildings, 
roads, construction/maintenance compound and hard standing.  The 
remaining 5.6 ha will remain undeveloped.  
1.2.5 
The Power Generation Plant will be accessed via Potash Lane, a 
private road to the south of the site.  Potash Lane in turn connects to 
Castleton Way via the former main runway. 
1.2.6 
The proposed route for the Gas Connection is from the south of the site 
adjacent to Castleton Way. It is proposed to bring the pipeline 
alongside Castleton Way and the A140 before directing it towards the 
Power Generation Plant to the south of White House Farm. The 
pipeline will be buried and the ground reinstated to existing conditions.  
1.2.7 
The proposed AGI will occupy an area of 0.6 ha and comprise 0.027 ha 
of impermeable surfaces, the remainder of which will be a compacted 
gravel construction and semi-permeable.  It will be accessed by a new 
access track with an area of approximately 0.3 ha from Castleton Way. 
The access track will be a tarmac construction.

1.2.8 
The proposed route of the Cable runs from the Power Generation Plant 
to the south of White House Farm before crossing under the A140 and 
continuing west. The Cable will be buried and the ground reinstated to 
existing conditions with the exception of the route beneath the A140 
and beneath watercourses where directional drilling will provide the 
route for the Cable. 
1.2.9 
It is proposed to locate a Substation and SEC alongside the National 
Grid overhead line, approximately 1.5 km west of the Power Generation 
Plant Site, to facilitate connection of the Power Generation Plant to the 
National Grid Network.   
1.2.10 
The proposed ECC will occupy an area of approximately 0.9 ha, of 
which approximately 0.19 ha will comprise impermeable surfaces and 
the remaining 0.71 ha will either remain undeveloped or comprise 
permeable gravel surfaces.  Access to the Substation will be provided 
by the Access Road from the A140 that will follow the route of the 
Cable. The area of the Access Road is approximately 0.4 ha, including 
the new area of junction onto the A140. The Access Road will be a 
tarmac construction.

Council 
For any planning decisions made during or after 
April 2014, Suffolk County Council requires the 
applicant to obtain drainage approval for any 
works affecting surface water in accordance with 
the Flood and Water Management Act 2010. 
SUDS should maintain greenfield runoff rates and 
be designed to be integrated into a wider network 
in due course to ensure efficient use of space in 
the airfield.  
Stresses the need to ensure that the Project and 
associated mitigation does not prejudice the ability 
of future development of the former Eye Airfield to 
come forward in accordance with the Mid Suffolk 
Eye Airfield Development Framework. 
Mid Suffolk 
District Council 
Consideration should be given to all surface water 
bodies within the vicinity of the site and the use of 
SUDS. 
The Eye Airfield Development Framework is soon 
to be adopted.

1.3.3 
Further consultation was undertaken with the EA in May 2013, June 
2013 and July 2013 to discuss the proposed methods for surface water 
management.  The EA confirmed that a surface water discharge must 
be limited to equivalent Greenfield runoff rates up to and including the 1 
in 100 year event (and allowing for the potential effects of climate 
change) and that a discharge rate of 10.11 l/s/ha during this event 
would be acceptable.  Further information regarding the calculation of 
Greenfield and post-developed runoff rates is provided in Section 5.3 of 
this FRA. 
1.3.4 
Following production of the Preliminary Environmental Information 
Report (PEIR), prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff, consultation with the 
relevant bodies was undertaken. In response to this consultation, the 
EA confirmed the requirements noted previously in Table 1. Yaxley and 
Thrandeston Parish Councils expressed concern over how increased 
quantities of surface water would be dealt with and Anglian Water 
noted that public sewers under their management lie within the site and 
that easements will be required for access to these.

ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
This FRA has been conducted in accordance with NPPF and 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1). These 
documents provide guidance on how new developments must take into 
account flood risk, including making allowance for climate change 
impacts. Specifically, they encourage decision makers to: 
 
Steer new development to lower risk locations that are appropriate 
to the proposed use and ensure development is safe;  
 
Prevent any increase in flood risk elsewhere and reduce flood risk 
through the layout and form of the development and the 
appropriate application of sustainable drainage systems; 
 
Reduce flood risk by making space for water by creating flood flow 
paths and by identifying, allocating and safeguarding space for 
flood storage; 
 
Use regeneration to help relocate development to lower risk 
locations when climate change is expected to mean that some 
existing development may not be sustainable in the long-term. 
2.2 
Methodology 
2.2.1 
The methodology adopted in this FRA comprises: 
 
Review of available flood risk data to identify existing flood risk from 
fluvial, tidal, groundwater, overland flow and artificial sources; 
 
Consideration of existing ground conditions on-site to determine 
groundwater levels, soil permeability, groundwater vulnerability and 
contamination risks; 
 
Review of the development proposals in terms of flood risk 
vulnerability and flood zone compatibility;  
 
Consideration of how the development proposals may affect flood 
risk to the site and surrounding land; and 
 
Proposals for the appropriate management of flood risks to 
facilitate development whilst not increasing risks elsewhere. 
2.2.2 
Data regarding flood risk relevant to the Project has been obtained from 
the following sources: 
 
EA indicative flood risk maps and groundwater maps; 


Definition of Flood Risk 
2.3.1 
Flood risk is the product of the likelihood or chance of a flood occurring 
(flood frequency) and the consequence or impact of the flooding (flood 
consequence).  
Flood Frequency 
2.3.2 
Flood frequency is identified in terms of the return period and annual 
probability. For example, a 1 in 100 year flood event has a 1% annual 
probability of occurring. Table 2 provides a conversion between return 
periods and annual flood probabilities.

2.3.3 
NPPF identifies Flood Zones in relation to flood frequency. The zones 
refer to the probability of river (fluvial) and sea (tidal) flooding, whilst 
ignoring the presence of defences. Table 3 summarises the relationship 
between Flood Zone category and the identified flood risk.

Flood Consequences 
2.3.4 
The consequence of a flood event describes the potential damage, 
danger and disruption caused by flooding. This is dependent on the 
mechanism and characteristics of the flood event and the vulnerability 
of the affected land and land use. 
2.3.5 
The EA have identified five classifications of flood risk vulnerability and 
provide recommendations on the compatibility of each vulnerability 
classification with the Flood Zones, as shown in Table 4. 
2.3.6 
Full details of the EA flood zones and flood risk vulnerability 
classifications can be found in the Technical Guidance to NPPF.

Potential Sources of Flooding 
2.4.1 
In accordance with NPPF, the following sources of flooding will be 
considered in this assessment:  
 
Fluvial flood risk from nearby watercourses; 
 
Overland surface water flooding from adjacent sites; 
 
Site generated surface water runoff; 
 
Surcharging of sewers; 
 
Groundwater flooding; and 
 
Tidal flooding. 
2.5 
Potential Effects of Climate Change 
2.5.1 
Scientific consensus is that the global climate is changing as a result of 
human activity. While there remain uncertainties in how a changing 
climate will affect areas already vulnerable to flooding, it is expected to 
increase risk significantly over time. For the UK, projections of future 
climate change indicate that more frequent short-duration high-intensity 
rainfall events and more frequent periods of long-duration rainfall could 
be expected. 
2.5.2 
The Technical Guidance to NPPF provides recommended national 
precautionary sensitivity ranges for possible peak rainfall intensities

The design life of the Power Generation Plant and associated drainage 
systems is estimated to be 25 years.  In accordance with NPPF climate 
change guidance, rainfall intensity could increase by up to 10% during 
the lifetime of the development.   
2.6 
The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 
2.6.1 
The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (FWMA) introduces new 
responsibilities for designated Risk Management Authorities with 
regards to flood risk and sustainable drainage.  The most notable 
features of the FWMA with regards to the Project are discussed below.  
2.6.2 
Under the FWMA, the unitary authority or county council for an area, in 
this case Suffolk County Council, is designated the ‘Lead Local Flood 
Authority’ (LLFA), with responsibility for managing flood risk from 
surface water, ground water and ordinary watercourses within their 
area.  
2.6.3 
Schedule 3 of the FWMA introduces new National Standards for 
Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDS) against which proposed 
drainage systems should comply.   
2.6.4 
Under Schedule 3 of the FWMA, LLFAs will become the SUDS 
Approving Body (SAB) for surface water drainage systems for new 
development and approval from the SAB for drainage proposals must 
be agreed prior to construction.  For drainage systems that serve more 
than one property, the SAB will have responsibility for the adoption and 
maintenance of SUDS schemes that meet SAB requirements. 
2.6.5 
The role of the SAB is due to come into force in late 2014.

Mid Suffolk Core Strategy Development Plan Document 
2.7.1 
The Mid Suffolk Core Strategy Development Plan Document (DPD) 
was adopted in September 2008. This document is key to the Mid 
Suffolk Local Development Framework (LDF) and sets out the vision, 
objectives, spatial strategy and core policies that will guide 
development across the district until 2025 and beyond.  
2.7.2 
The vision for the Core Strategy DPD includes the needs for new 
development to tackle the predicted impacts of climate change, 
including increased flood risk.  This vision is integrated within the 
strategic policies as set out within Section 3 of the Core Strategy DPD, 
specifically Policy CS 4 that states that the Council will support 
development proposals that avoid areas of current and future flood risk, 
and which do not increase flooding elsewhere, adopting the 
precautionary principle to development  proposals.  This includes the 
implementation of SUDS into all new developments where technically 
feasible. 
2.7.3 
The Eye Airfield Industrial Estate is allocated within the Core Strategy 
DPD for employment land between 2001 – 2021 to meet indicative 
targets for additional jobs in Mid Suffolk, specifically for Use Classes 
B1, B2 and B8.   
2.8 
Eye Airfield Development Framework (February 2013 post 
consultation draft) 
2.8.1 
Whilst not yet possessing formal status within the Mid Suffolk LDF, the 
draft Eye Airfield Development Framework (EADF) seeks to provide the 
Council’s interpretation of the Core Strategy and other policies as they 
relate to Eye Airfield and provide additional baseline information. The 
intention is to guide investment and provide a framework for the 
Council’s consideration of planning proposals for development as they 
come forward. 
2.8.2 
Reflecting the Mid Suffolk Core Strategy DPD, the EADF reconfirms 
Eye Airfield’s importance as an employment area.  Different areas of 
the site are proposed for varying types of development, including; 
business, residential, energy, common/open space, allotments and 
agricultural.  
2.8.3 
The centre of the site has been proposed for energy producing 
developments, which should be ‘appropriate provided they meet 
environmental criteria that ensure a good quality of life for all around 
them’.

2.8.4 
Chapter 4 of the EADF sets out the development principles for the site.  
This includes the need for sustainable surface water management 
within an overall jointly managed surface water drainage strategy.  The 
document goes on to state that it is proposed that SUDS are used on 
Eye Airfield, but that the details need to be carefully worked out due to 
heavy clay soils.  The range of SUDS measures considered 
appropriate for this site are discussed in detail within the EADF 
document.

SITE DESCRIPTION 
3.1 
Site Location 
3.1.1 
The Power Generation Plant Site is located within the former Eye 
Airfield. The former Eye Airfield accommodates several industrial parks, 
including: Brome Industrial Estate (to the north), Eye Airfield Industrial 
Estate (to the north-east), Mid Suffolk Business Park (to the east) and 
Oaksmere Business Park (to the west). The Power Generation Plant 
Site is located within a larger triangular area directly to the east of the 
former ‘main runway’ and north of the former SW-NE runway.   
3.1.2 
The extent of the Project Site boundary extends to the west of the Eye 
Airfield Industrial Estate, as illustrated in Figure 2.  This defines the 
total works area for the Project including the electrical and gas 
connections.  A description of the development proposals is provided in 
Section 1.3. 
3.2 
Site Description 
3.2.1 
The Power Generation Plant Site and immediate surrounding area is 
characterised by the remnants of the airfield, including the runway and 
the access roads. Buildings that once formed part of the airfield have 
been replaced by industrial units accommodating various industrial 
activities including a power generation facility located to the north of the 
site (the 12.7 MW Eye Power Station), factory to the west of the site 
and a National Grid Gas Compressor Station to the east of the site.  
3.2.2 
There are also two wind turbines to the west of Potash Lane operated 
by Triodos Renewables and two more to the south of the Power 
Generation Plant Site at Baldwin Farm.  The approximate location of 
these turbines is illustrated in Figure 2. 
3.2.3 
The proposed Project Site area currently comprises greenfield 
agricultural land with the exception of the A140 and smaller access 
roads.  
3.2.4 
The Power Generation Plant Site is generally flat, with slight undulation, 
falling very gently towards the east and south toward the proposed 
Above Ground Installation.  The local ‘high point’ of the area of 
approximately 49m Above Ordnance datum (AOD) is located within the 
Power Generation Plant Site. Land within the wider site boundary is 
also generally flat.  To the west of the Power Generation Plant, in the 
area of the proposed Substation and SEC, topography falls very gently 
towards the north.

Surface Water Features 
3.3.1 
There are no known surface water features located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  There are also no known surface water features 
within, or alongside, the Gas Connection.  
3.3.2 
With regards to the Electrical Connection, the route of the Cable and 
Access Road to the ECC crosses a drainage ditch approximately 75 m 
west of the A140, immediately to the south of Yaxley Lake which is 
used for fishing.   Yaxley Lake is not believed to have any formal 
designation but is stocked with common, mirror, tench and crucian 
carp.  It has been surveyed for newts and it is concluded that newts are 
likely to be absent from the pond. A detailed description is provided in 
Section 10 (Ecology) of the Environmental Statement.  The drainage 
ditch was dry on the day of the site visit (November 2013) and there

was no visible flow into or out of the lake.  Water within the lake was 
reported to be stagnant and a large bloom of algae was visible.   
3.3.3 
A watercourse / highway drain flows adjacent to the A140 (eastern 
verge) and will be crossed beneath by the Electrical Connection.  The 
watercourse is discussed in greater detail in Section 3.4 below.     
3.3.4 
There are no other known surface water features within the wider 
Project Site.  
3.3.5 
A number of small drainage ditches and ponds are located within the 
surrounding land outside of the red line boundary, as illustrated in the 
figure in Appendix B. 
3.3.6 
Of key importance is the unnamed culverted watercourse to the north 
of the Power Generation Plant Site that flows from west to east 
between the A140 and B1077.  After passing beneath the B1077, the 
watercourse flows in an open channel to confluence within the River 
Dove approximately 15. km east of the B1077.   It is believed that this 
watercourse may have been excavated to support the development of 
the Mid Suffolk Business Park. It is currently unknown who owns and/or 
manages this watercourse. 
3.3.7 
The closest Main River to the Project is the River Dove located 
approximately 2 km to the east of the Power Generation Plant Site.  
The River Dove flows in a north-easterly direction to confluence with 
the River Waveney approximately 3.8 km to the north.  
3.4 
Existing Surface Water Drainage 
3.4.1 
The surface water drainage scheme serving the former Eye Airfield is 
split into a number of catchments.  The description of the existing 
surface water drainage system presented within this FRA is based on 
information provided within the EADF, review  of historic drainage plans 
and review of drawings provided by Mr Whiting (local land owner) of 
ditches and culverts to the west of the A140 near the area labelled 
‘Goswold Hall’ on Ordinance Survey mapping.   
3.4.2 
The existing development to the north of the Power Generation Plant 
Site (namely the Eye Airfield Industrial Estate, Mid Suffolk Business 
Park and Brome Industrial Estate) is believed to drain predominantly to 
the existing culverted watercourse that runs from west to east between 
the A140 and B1077.  Runoff will subsequently be conveyed to the 
River Dove approximately 1.5 km east of the B1077.

3.4.3 
Surface water runoff from the Mid Suffolk Business Park is drained via 
adopted Anglian Water sewers to a pumping station, prior to water 
being pumped into the culverted watercourse.  
3.4.4 
Drainage plans produced in 2002 (Cotton and Downes) indicate an 
existing collector drain located along the western boundary of the 
Power Generation Plant Site.  This drain appears to collect runoff from 
a french drain arrangement located within the Power Generation Plant 
Site, and discharges to an existing drain located adjacent to Eye Power 
Station that continues to flow north.  A copy of this plan is provided in 
Appendix C.  This drain may discharge to the existing culverted 
watercourse that runs from west to east between the A140 and B1077, 
or it may discharge to the watercourse / highway drain that runs along 
the A140 (as discussed below).  
3.4.5 
Development on the west of the former Eye Airfield (adjacent to the 
A140) is believed to discharge via a balancing pond and settlement 
tank to a watercourse / highway drain that runs along the A140. This 
section of the watercourse / highway drain is believed to discharge into 
the culverted watercourse that crosses north of the Power Generation 
Plant Site as discussed above, although this connection has not been 
confirmed.  The EADF suggests that this section of the Eye Airfield 
Industrial Estate may discharge to the west across the A140 and maps 
provided by Mr Whiting illustrating farm drainage to the west of the 
A140 also indicates this to be the case. If this is the case, the surface 
water discharges into a series of land drains that passes through the 
farms to the west of the A140 at this point and discharges into the 
Thrandeston Beck.  The drainage of this area of the Project Site will 
need to be confirmed during the detailed design of the proposed 
drainage system. 
3.4.6 
Surface water runoff from the former runways on the former Eye Airfield 
are generally channelled into holes drilled into the airfield which 
discharge to a french drain arrangement.  This network of drains is 
prevalent throughout much of the greenfield land within the former Eye 
Airfield.  Review of historic drainage plans suggest that the drains in the 
northern and western parts of the former Eye Airfield connect to carrier 
drains within the A140, which in turn may discharge to the culverted 
watercourse that crosses the former Eye Airfield or may discharge to 
the west across the A140 as discussed above. 
3.4.7 
Review of historic drainage plans suggests that drains in the south of 
the former Eye Airfield connect to a carrier drain located in Castleton 
Way.  Surface water runoff from arable land in the southeast of the 
former Eye Airfield is believed to drain to a drainage ditch located along 
a field boundary, which then discharges to an adopted sewer across

Castleton Way, and into a tributary of the River Dove located in the 
north of Eye. 
3.4.8 
The majority of the former runway and field drainage system is believed 
to be in poor condition or completely blocked. 
3.4.9 
Surface water drainage in the greenfield area where it is proposed to 
locate the ECC is unknown but expected to be absent. Plans provided 
by Mr Whiting indicate the nearest watercourse to be a drainage ditch 
approximately 250m to the north-east of the ECC which flows north-
east toward Goswald Hall. 
3.5 
Geology  
3.5.1 
The bedrock geology within the area of the Project comprises Crag 
Group, formed of sand and sedimentary bedrock.  The bedrock geology 
is overlain by superficial deposits comprising Lowestoft Formation 
(Diamicton), predominantly of chalky till.  
3.5.2 
The permeability of the superficial deposits is typically low, although its 
variable nature may mean that local areas of higher permeability may 
be present. This is confirmed through review of the Mid Suffolk SFRA 
that states that the chalky till and drift geology within the area of Eye is 
‘moderately drained and seasonally waterlogged’.  The SFRA goes 
onto to state that, with regards to SUDS opportunities, this geology 
would be appropriate for combined infiltration and attenuation systems.   
3.5.3 
Land within the boundary of the former Eye Airfield may be at risk of 
ground contamination associated with historic land uses.  This includes 
the Power Generation Plant Site as well as the Gas Connection and 
Electrical within the boundary of the former Eye airfield.  Land to the 
west of the A140 (i.e. in the area of the Cable and ECC) is unlikely to 
be at risk of contamination.  More information is provided in Section 10 
(Geology, Land Contamination and Agriculture) of the Environmental 
Statement.  
3.6 
Hydrogeology 
3.6.1 
The bedrock geology within this area is classified as a Principal Aquifer.  
These aquifers are layers of rock or drift deposits that have high 
intergranular and/or fracture permeability, meaning they usually provide 
a high level of water storage. They may support water supply and/or 
river base flow on a strategic scale.   
3.6.2 
The superficial geology within this area is classified as unproductive 
strata.  These are rock layers or drift deposits with low permeability that 
have negligible significance for water supply or river base flow.

3.6.3 
Review of groundwater vulnerability maps indicates that the soils 
overlying these aquifers are of low permeability within the areas of the 
Project Site. This is illustrated in Figure 3.  Note that the aquifer 
designations used within the groundwater vulnerability map below (i.e. 
Major, Minor and Non-Aquifer) were superseded in 2010 by the 
terminology used above (i.e. Principal and Secondary), although the 
soil classifications remain valid.  
Figure 3: Groundwater vulnerability (Reference: Environment Agency 
Groundwater Map) 
 
 
3.6.4 
The Principal Aquifer beneath the Project Site forms part of the EA’s 
designated Source Protection Zones (SPZ).  A SPZ denotes an aquifer 
that is used for public potable water supply and activities within the SPZ 
are controlled by the EA to reduce contaminations risks. 
3.6.5 
With reference to Figure 4, the red area denotes the inner protection 
zone (SPZ1) which is the most sensitive and protected area of the SPZ. 
The green area denotes the outer protection zone (SPZ2) and the blue 
area denotes the total catchment area (SPZ3) which is the total area 
needed to support the water demand abstracted from this source.

Figure 4: Groundwater Source Protection Zones (Reference: 
Environment Agency Groundwater Map) 
 
3.6.6 
The northern tip of the Power Generation Plant Site is located within 
SPZ3. Electrical and Gas Connections are also located in SPZ3. 
3.6.7 
EA guidance ‘Groundwater Protection: Policy and Practice’ sets 
limitations on the discharge of liquid effluent into a SPZ.  In summary, it 
is generally not permitted to discharge surface water runoff from roads, 
vehicle parking or public amenity areas to SPZ1, although it is 
permitted to discharge surface water runoff from these areas to SPZ2 
and SPZ3 through the use of SUDS.  The use of deep soakaways 
within all areas of a SPZ for surface water disposal will generally not be 
permitted. 
3.6.8 
Within all areas of the SPZ, the EA will object to high risk developments 
(such as loading areas, service yards, chemical storage areas, garage 
forecourts, lorry parks, scrap yards etc) discharging surface water 
runoff to ground unless the site has been subject to risk assessment 
and acceptable effluent treatment is provided.

EXISTING FLOOD RISK 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
This section of the report provides an overview of any existing flood risk 
to the Project or surrounding land from fluvial, tidal, groundwater, 
overland flow and artificial sources.  Consideration is also given to the 
potential effects of climate change on existing flood risk.  All data has 
been sourced through desk based review of published documents and 
no additional quantitative analysis or modelling has been undertaken to 
inform this assessment.   
4.2 
Fluvial Flood Risk 
4.2.1 
Review of the EA indicative flood maps, as illustrated in Figure 5, 
indicates that the whole of the Project Site is located within the low risk 
Flood Zone 1.  This has been confirmed through direct consultation 
with the EA.  The development is therefore not considered to be at risk 
from fluvial flooding.

Agency Flood Map for Planning (Rivers and Sea))

4.2.2 
Part of the town of Eye to the south-east of the Project Site is at risk 
from fluvial flooding from the River Dove and its tributary to the west of 
Eye.  The Core Strategy DPD states that the town of Eye has 
historically been constrained from expanding to the east, south and 
west by low lying land liable to flooding from the River Dove and its 
tributaries. 
4.2.3 
The Project Site and surrounding land (including the town of Eye) is not 
in an area that receives EA flood warnings. 
4.3 
Tidal Flood Risk 
4.3.1 
The Project Site and surrounding land is not in an area deemed to be at 
risk of tidal flooding. 
4.4 
Surface Water Flood Risk 
4.4.1 
Within this FRA, surface water flood risk encompasses flooding 
associated with ordinary watercourses (not mapped as fluvial flood 
risks as discussed above), surface water runoff that has not yet entered 
the surface water drainage system and/or watercourse, and flooding 
associated with the surcharging of the below ground sewerage 
network.  
4.4.2 
The EADF states that parts of the Eye Airfield Industrial Site to the 
north of the Power Generation Plant have experienced occasional 
surface water flooding, deemed to be as a result of a combination of 
blocked surface water drains within the airfield hardstanding, blockages 
within the culverted watercourse and also a lack of capacity in the 
culverted watercourse.  
4.4.3 
The Power Generation Plant is located at a local ‘high point’ of 
approximately 49m AOD.  The risk of flooding to the Power Generation 
Plant from runoff from adjacent land entering the site is therefore 
considered to be low, although any increase in runoff from the Power 
Generation Plant could increase risks to adjacent land.  
4.4.4 
Review of the EA’s Flood Map for Surface Water (FMfSW) indicates 
that shallow flooding associated with surface water runoff may occur 
within the Eye Airfield Industrial Estate and Brome Industrial Estate to 
the north of the Power Generation Plant Site during the modelled 1 in 
30 year event.  Other areas of the industrial estates to the north are 
indicated to be risk of shallow surface water flooding during the larger 
modelled 1 in 200 year event.  The FMfSW assess the likelihood of 
surface water flooding based on review of site topography.  Identified 
flood risks are therefore likely to be associated with the relative flat

topography of these areas and the presence of buildings that will 
interrupt the natural flow of water.  
4.4.5 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are not located in areas 
to be at significant risk from surface water flooding. The only reported 
flooding is provided in a report from Mr Whiting that states that on the 
5th February 2014 flooding of land at Farms in Thrandeston occurred 
approximately 2km to the north of the ECC.  
4.4.6 
The FMfSW indicates that the town of Eye may be at risk of surface 
water flooding.  This appears to be principally associated with runoff 
from the land to the north, in particular an existing land drain that 
passes through the town from agricultural land to the north before 
discharging to the River Dove.  
4.5 
Groundwater Flood Risk 
4.5.1 
Groundwater flooding occurs when water stored below ground reaches 
the ground’s surface, causing flooding of below ground structures and 
often leading to overland flow.  Groundwater flooding is commonly 
associated with porous underlying geology, such as chalk, limestone 
and gravels.  
4.5.2 
The superficial geology underlying the Project Site is relatively 
impermeable and therefore unlikely to support groundwater flooding.  
This is reaffirmed by the lack of records of groundwater flooding in this 
area, of which there are none. The reported flooding of farmland near 
Thrandeston is not attributed to any particular source. 
4.6 
Artificial Sources of Flood Risk 
4.6.1 
Artificial sources of flooding are considered to be sources such as 
canals, reservoirs and lakes.   
4.6.2 
Review of EA indicative flood maps indicates that the Project Site and 
surrounding land is not at risk of flooding from reservoirs. 
4.6.3 
There are no canals or significant lakes within close proximity of the 
Project Site that are considered to pose flood risk to the area.  
4.7 
Potential Effects of Climate Change 
4.7.1 
As discussed in Section 2.5, climate change is predicted to increase 
rainfall intensity and peak river flow, thus exacerbating existing flood 
risk.    
4.7.2 
With regards to fluvial flood risk, this may increase the extent and 
frequency of flooding associated with main rivers and ordinary

watercourses, although this is not predicted to increase flood risk to the 
Project Site.   
4.7.3 
An increase in rainfall intensity could increase the frequency of surface 
water flooding within parts of the Eye Airfield Industrial Site to the north 
of the Power Generation Plant Site, in particular flooding that is 
attributable to a lack of capacity in the culverted watercourse that 
passes through this area.  This increase in flood risk is unlikely to pose 
an increased risk to flooding within the Power Generation Plant Site, 
but any increase in discharge to the watercourse (i.e. from the Power 
Generation Plant) may increase flood risk elsewhere.   
4.7.4 
Climate change is not predicted to increase flood risks associated with 
tidal, groundwater or artificial sources within the vicinity of the Project 
Site. 
4.8 
Summary of Existing Flood Risk 
4.8.1 
The Project Site is not considered to be at significant risk from any 
source of flooding, namely fluvial, tidal, groundwater, overland flow and 
artificial sources.   
4.8.2 
The greatest risk of flooding to adjacent land is associated with surface 
water runoff, with reported flood incidents within the Eye Airfield 
Industrial Site to the north of the Power Generation Plant Site.  This is 
deemed to be as a result of a combination of blocked surface water 
drains within the airfield hardstandings, blockages within the culverted 
watercourse and also a lack of capacity in the culverted watercourse.  
Climate change could exacerbate flooding from this source. 
4.8.3 
Any increase in surface water runoff from the Power Generation Plant 
Site could exacerbate existing surface water flood risk within the Eye 
Airfield Industrial Site and within the town of Eye to the south-east.

POST DEVELOPMENT FLOOD RISK AND DRAINAGE STRATEGY 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
This section of the report provides a summary of the potential impacts 
that identified flood risk could have on the Project, as well as the 
potential impacts that the Project could have on people and property 
elsewhere.  Where appropriate, mitigation measures to manage any 
identified risks are proposed.  This includes a description of the 
proposed surface water management strategy.  
5.2 
Development Vulnerability 
5.2.1 
Review of existing flood risks (and any increased risk associated with 
climate change effects) has identified that the Project Site is located 
within the low risk Flood Zone 1 and is not considered to be at 
significant risk from any source of flooding, namely fluvial, tidal, 
groundwater, overland flow and artificial sources.   
5.2.2 
With reference to NPPF Technical Guidance, the Project is classified 
as Essential Infrastructure in terms of its flood risk vulnerability 
classification (namely ‘electricity generating power stations and grid 
and primary Substations’, Table 2,  NPPF Technical Guidance: Flood 
risk vulnerability classification).   With reference to Table 4 in Section 2 
of this FRA, this type of development is classified as appropriate in 
Flood Zone 1. 
5.3 
Increased Surface Water Runoff 
5.3.1 
Section 4 of this FRA has identified that the greatest risk of flooding to 
adjacent land is associated with surface water runoff, with reported 
flood incidents within the former Eye Airfield Industrial Site to the north 
of the Power Generation Plant Site.  The town of Eye may also be at 
risk of surface water flooding, principally associated with runoff from the 
land to the north. 
5.3.2 
Any increase in surface water runoff from the Project Site, including 
that associated with climate change effects, could exacerbate existing 
surface water flood risk within the former Eye Airfield Industrial Site and 
within the town of Eye to the south-east.    
5.3.3 
Works associated with the Power Generation Plant Site will result in the 
most notable increase to the rate and volume of surface water runoff.  
The increase in runoff associated with the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection will be comparatively less.  The assessment of 
increased flood risk as a result of the Project will therefore focus on the 
development of the Power Generation Plant Site. Details of flood risk

as a result of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are dealt 
with in Section 5.5.   
5.3.4 
The Power Generation Plant will occupy an area of approximately 7.5 
ha.  Up to 1.9 ha of the development will be impermeable, comprising 
buildings, roads, construction / maintenance compound and hard 
standing.  The remaining 5.6 ha of this area will remain undeveloped or 
surfaced with gravel and therefore permeable as per current conditions.    
5.3.5 
If unmitigated, the construction of the Power Generation Plant would 
most likely increase flood risk within the Eye Airfield Industrial Site to 
the north and to downstream receptors that are at existing risk of fluvial 
flooding from the River Dove.  The development may also increase 
flood risk within the town of Eye if water is not intercepted by a 
drainage system and is instead allowed to runoff naturally.  
5.3.6 
In order to ensure no increase in flood risk associated with surface 
water runoff over the lifetime of the Project and to meet the 
requirements of the EA and Suffolk County Council, the Power 
Generation Plant Site will be supported by a SUDS system that 
attenuates surface water runoff to the equivalent greenfield runoff rate 
up to and including the 1 in 100 year event whilst allowing for the 
potential effects of climate change. 
5.3.7 
Existing Greenfield runoff rates have been calculated using the Institute 
of Hydrology Report 124 (IH124) methodology.  These are presented 
within Table 6, providing runoff rates per hectare and for the Power 
Generation Site area of 1.9 ha.  The runoff rate per hectare has been 
agreed with the EA through consultation undertaken July 2013.

5.4.3 
The draft National Standards for SUDS was published by DEFRA in 
December 2011 and sets out the principles by which surface water 
drainage systems should be designed in the future.  The final document 
is still in preparation and is due to be published in late 2014 to enable 
Schedule 3 of the FWMA to be enacted.  Although still in draft form, the 
surface water drainage strategy proposed within this FRA aims to meet 
the requirements of the draft National Standards for SUDS. 
Surface water discharge 
5.4.4 
The draft National Standards for SUDS requires that the following 
methods of surface water disposal are considered in order of 
preference: 
1. Discharge into the ground; 
2. Discharge to a surface water body; 
3. Discharge to a surface water sewer; 
4. Discharge to a combined sewer.

5.4.5 
Review of underlying ground conditions suggests that the ground within 
the site boundary will not support significant infiltration of surface water 
runoff.  Contamination may also be present near the airfield that could 
limit the use of infiltration systems.  Further site investigation will be 
undertaken during the detailed design of the Project to ascertain likely 
infiltration rates and contamination risks.  If deemed suitable, infiltration 
of surface water runoff will be maximised through the use of combined 
infiltration and attenuation systems.  However, it is considered likely 
that some discharge of surface water elsewhere will still be required. 
5.4.6 
It is proposed that surface water runoff from the Power Generation 
Plant Site that cannot be managed through infiltration alone will be 
discharge to the existing drainage connection located to the north of the 
Power Generation Plant Site adjacent to Eye Power Station (as 
illustrated in Appendix C).  This drain may discharge to the existing 
culverted watercourse that runs from west to east between the A140 
and B1077, or it may discharge to the watercourse / highway drain that 
runs along the A140 (noting that this drain may also discharge to the 
same culverted watercourse  as discussed above, or to the west across 
the A140). Further investigation will be required during detailed design 
of the proposed drainage system to confirm the flow of water in these 
systems, confirm available capacity and gain approval from the relevant 
authorities. 
5.4.7 
The draft National Standards for SUDS requires development to 
achieve no discharge to a surface water body or feature resulting from 
the first 5 mm of any rainfall event.  The proposed drainage strategy for 
the Power Generation Plant Site will aim to achieve this requirement by 
promoting infiltration and/or evaporation of surface water runoff through 
the use of unlined storage and conveyance systems, as well as the 
storage and conveyance of water on the ground’s surface wherever 
possible.  This is discussed further in the sections below.   
Attenuation requirements 
5.4.8 
Surface water runoff from the Power Generation Plant Site will be 
attenuated to existing Greenfield runoff rates up to and including the 1 
in 100 year event, calculated to be approximately 19.21 l/s (10.11 
l/s/ha).  For the purpose of sizing required attenuation systems, a worst 
case scenario has been adopted that assumes no infiltration to ground.  
The attenuation system will be designed to accommodate the potential 
effects of climate change over the lifetime of the Project, which is 
estimated to be 25 years.  In accordance with NPPF climate change 
guidance, rainfall intensity will increase by up to 10% during this time.  
5.4.9 
Table 8 presents the calculated storage requirements to attenuate 
surface water runoff to Greenfield rates, based on a total impermeable

area at the Power Generation Plant Site of 1.9 ha.  Estimates were 
prepared using the MicroDrainage Quick Storage Estimate tool that 
provides a range of likely required storage volumes.  A more accurate 
sizing of the required storage volume will be undertaken during the 
detailed design stage of the Project when a more detailed 
representation of the proposed drainage system can be made.   At this 
stage, the design will ensure that the maximum required storage 
volume can be accommodated within the site boundary (i.e. 961 m3).

5.4.10 
The draft National Standards for SUDS requires that surface water 
runoff is managed on the ground surface where it is reasonably 
practicable to do so.  This is reaffirmed by the EADF that promotes the 
use of open ponds and wetlands, and the use of conveyance systems 
such as open swales, ditches and filter strips.  It is proposed that the 
attenuation requirements calculated above will be provided within an 
open detention pond within the Power Generation Plant Site.  At this 
stage it is proposed that the base of this pond will remain unlined to 
promote infiltration, although this will confirmed following a more 
detailed site investigation that will assess contaminated risks.  
Conveyance 
5.4.11 
Where practical, surface water runoff from all impermeable areas will 
be conveyed within open swales, ditches and filter strips located 
adjacent to the proposed access roads.  A detailed topographic survey 
of the site has been completed which will be used during the detailed 
design of the Power Generation Plant to inform the design of these 
systems.  Review of OS maps indicates that the site’s topography is 
very flat with a gentle slope towards the south and the east.  However, 
review of the existing surface water drainage system within the Power 
Generation Plant Site boundary indicates that surface water is currently 
conveyed towards the north.

Treatment 
5.4.12 
The Power Generation Plant Site contains items that could pose risk to 
the receiving surface water environment, such as runoff from 
roads/parking and accidental spillage from oil and chemical storage 
tanks. 
5.4.13 
Detailed mitigation to manage risks associated with these areas is 
provided within Chapter 9 (Water Quality and Resources) of the 
Environmental Statement.  In summary, runoff from low risk areas, 
such as building roofs and minor access roads, will be treated through 
the use of SUDS techniques as discussed above.  Runoff from high risk 
areas, such as the lorry/car parking areas, construction/maintenance 
compound and storage tanks, will be passed through an oil separator 
prior to discharge to conveyance structures and/or the detention pond.  
The separator will be designed in accordance with PPG3: Use and 
Design of Oil Separators in Surface Water Drainage Systems.  
5.4.14 
The northern tip of the Power Generation Plant Site is located within 
SPZ3.  Within this zone, the EA generally permits the discharge of 
surface water runoff from roads and parking areas to the ground 
through the use of SUDS, although the use of deep soakaways will 
generally not be permitted.  The EA will generally object to high risk 
activities (such as loading areas, lorry parking, service yards, and 
chemical and oil storage areas) in SPZ3 unless acceptable treatment is 
provided.    
5.4.15 
The proposed methods for managing risks associated with the 
discharge of potentially polluted runoff will be agreed with the EA during 
the detailed design of the Power Generation Plant.  However, it is 
considered that the use of a robust oil separator and shallow SUDS 
conveyance and storage measures will provide adequate protection to 
groundwater and surface water quality.  
Designing for exceedence 
5.4.16 
The proposed surface water drainage system will be designed to 
provide capacity for up to the 1 in 30 year event, at minimum, to meet 
the requirements of the draft National Strategy for SUDS and in 
accordance with Sewers for Adoption.  Flooding from the drainage 
system will therefore not occur during events equal to or less than the 1 
in 30 year event. 
5.4.17 
The management of surface water runoff during events greater than the 
1 in 30 year event will be developed in detail during the detailed design 
of the Power Generation Plant.  This may comprise the use of 
conveyance structures that have capacity for events greater than the in

1 in 30 year event, or the profiling of land within the site boundary to 
manage overland flow during events greater than the in 1 in 30 year 
event.  The design will ensure that no flooding will occur to the following 
receptors up to and including the 1 in 100 year event and allowing for 
the potential effects of climate change: 
 
Any part of the workshops, office and store; 
 
Any plant sensitive to full or partial submergence (such as electrical 
equipment); 
 
Land outside of the Power Generation Plant Site boundary.  
Summary 
5.4.18 
In summary, the proposed surface water drainage system for the 
Power Generation Plant Site will meet the following principles: 
 
No runoff from the development from rainfall depths up to 5mm; 
 
No increase in the volume or rate of surface water runoff from the 
site in the 1 in 1 and 1 in 100 year rainfall events; 
 
No increase in flooding to people and property elsewhere as a 
result of the development; 
 
No surface water flooding within the proposed development in all 
rainfall events up to and including a 1 in 30 year return period 
storm; 
 
Overland flows within the site from rainfall events in exceedence of 
a 1 in 30 year return period storm are to be managed to minimise 
risk to people and property, up to the 1 in 100 year return period 
storm; 
 
The surface water management proposals are to be designed to 
allow for a 10% increase in rainfall intensity in the 1 in 100 year 
rainfall event over the lifetime of the development; 
 
Surface water runoff will be treated through the use of SUDS and 
oil separator.  
5.5 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
5.5.1 
The proposed Substation and SEC will occupy an area of 
approximately 0.9 ha, of which approximately 0.19 ha will comprise 
impermeable surfaces and the remaining 0.71 ha will either remain 
undeveloped or comprise permeable gravel surfaces. The proposed 
AGI will occupy an area of 0.9 ha which is assumed to comprise 
impermeable surfaces only.

5.5.2 
The Cable and Gas Connection pipeline will be buried and the ground 
reinstated as per existing conditions. The increase in surface water 
runoff associated with the Cable and pipeline is therefore considered to 
be negligible and no surface water drainage system is proposed.  
5.5.3 
It is proposed to discharge surface water runoff from the impermeable 
surface areas at the ECC and the AGI via infiltration into the ground. 
Whilst infiltration rates are expected to be limited due to the relatively 
low permeability of local geology, it is proposed that combined 
attenuation and infiltration structures will be provided that will store 
runoff from the relatively small impermeable areas prior to infiltration. 
Further testing will be undertaken during the detailed design of the 
proposed works to confirm on-site infiltration rates.  If infiltration does 
not prove to be a viable option, alternative methods will be explored 
that may include the discharge of surface water runoff to a local 
drainage ditch following consultation and agreement with relevant 
parties. 
5.5.4 
Access to the ECC and AGI will be provided by means of a new Access 
Road from the A140 and a new access from Potash Lane respectively. 
The roads are proposed to be of tarmac construction. The area of the 
Access Road is approximately 0.4 ha excluding the area of the new 
junction already within the A140 boundary. The area of the access road 
to the AGI is approximately 0.3 ha 
5.5.5 
It is proposed that surface runoff from the access roads will be 
managed by allowing surface water to runoff to infiltration trenches to 
be constructed adjacent to the access roads. This provides above 
ground management of surface water in line with the draft National 
Standards for SUDS and, given the proposed infrequent use of these 
access roads, this is deemed to provide adequate treatment of surface 
water runoff.  
5.5.6 
If it is not possible to manage all surface water runoff via infiltration due 
to soil characteristics, alternative methods will be explored that can 
provide combined attenuation and infiltration.  One option could be to 
provide an attenuated discharge into existing highway drainage in the 
A140 and Castleton Way, although this option will require further 
consultation and agreement with the highways authority.  If this option 
is progressed, it is proposed to use a ‘french drain’ style collector drain 
adjacent to the access roads.  These collector drains will be unlined to 
promote any infiltration that is available. The collector drains will be 
sized to attenuate discharge to the Greenfield runoff rate up to the 1 in 
100 year event including an allowance for climate change in 
accordance with the requirements of NPPF detailed in Table 5 of this 
report.

stage, the design will ensure that the maximum required storage 
volume can be accommodated within the Project Site boundary.

the gravel filled collector drains.

Adoption and maintenance 
5.6.1 
The adoption and maintenance of the surface water network at the 
Project Site is not confirmed but the following considerations have been 
made: 
 
The proposed surface water drainage system that serves the ECC, 
AGI and access roads will most likely be adopted by the plant 
operator and/or as part of a maintenance contract for the wider Eye 
Airfield Industrial Site. If the proposed surface water drainage 
system only serves the Power Generation Plant Site, it is unlikely to 
be adopted by the SAB (Suffolk County Council) under Schedule 3 
of the FWMA. 
 
It is possible that the owner and/or maintainer of the drain to the 
west of the Power Generation Plant Site may also wish to take 
ownership of the Power Generation Plant Site drainage.  If this 
network of drains starts to increase and/or they connect into the 
Anglian Water sewers to the north, Anglian Water may also wish to 
adopt this portion of drainage.  
 
If the proposed surface water drainage system that serves the 
Power Generation Plant Site will eventually form part of the 
drainage system that serves other plots, it might then be adopted 
by the SAB and/or Anglian Water. 
5.6.2 
The adoption and maintenance of the surface water network at the 
Project Site will be confirmed during the detailed design of the works.  
5.7 
Flood Resistance and Resilience Measures 
5.7.1 
Flood resistance comprises measures that prevent flooding to 
potentially vulnerable receptors, such as the ingress of water into 
occupied buildings.  Flood resilience measures comprise measures that 
enable a potential receptor to adapt or recover from a flooding event, 
for example managing the risk after flood water has entered a building.  
Both measures are equally as important to the management of flood 
risk to development. 
5.7.2 
Flood resistance measures that have already been proposed as part of 
the Power Generation Plant Site, ECC and AGI comprise the provision 
of a robust surface water drainage strategy as discussed above.  In 
addition, it is recommended that vulnerable aspects of these areas of 
development (such as occupied buildings and electrical equipment) is 
protected further through resistance measures such as raising 
threshold levels or plinths approximately 100-150 mm above ground 
levels to prevent ingress / submergence from overland flow.

5.7.3 
Flood resilience measures that could be considered as part of the 
design could include the use of water-resistant materials for floors, 
walls and fixtures and the siting of electrical controls, cables and 
appliances at a higher than normal level.  
5.8 
Flood Defence Consent 
5.8.1 
The Cable and Access Road to the ECC crosses a drainage ditch 
approximately 75 m west of the A140, immediately to the south of 
Yaxley Lake.  
5.8.2 
The Cable also passes beneath a watercourse / highway drain that 
flows adjacent to the A140 (eastern verge). 
5.8.3 
This path will be constructed using below ground directional drilling 
techniques that will not require open excavation.  The depth of the 
drainage ditches is unknown but it is expected that the depth of the 
drilled electrical connection corridor will be great enough that the drilled 
connection route will not impact the drains.  
5.8.4 
The Access Road will require the construction of a culvert to enable 
access across the drainage ditch south of Yaxley Lake.  Details of the 
culvert design are unknown at this stage and will be developed during 
the detailed design of the works.  However, the design will ensure no 
impact to the hydraulic capacity of the drainage ditch or the 
hydromorphological, chemical or ecological status of Yaxley Lake.  
5.8.5 
Consideration of the impacts to water quality is provided in Section 9 
(Water Quality and Resources) of the Environmental Statement. 
5.8.6 
Consent for working in close proximity to the above mentioned 
watercourses will be obtained from the relevant authority during the 
detailed design phase and prior to construction.

SEQUENTIAL TEST AND EXCEPTION TEST 
6.1 
The Sequential Test 
6.1.1 
NPPF recommends that the risk-based Sequential Test should be 
applied by the Local Planning Authority when considering applications 
for new development.  Its aim is to steer new development to areas at 
the lowest risk of flooding (Flood Zone 1). Where this is not possible, 
higher risk flood zones can be considered, but in the context of Flood 
Risk Vulnerability Classification and the possible application of the 
Exception Test. 
6.1.2 
With reference to NPPF Technical Guidance, the Project is classified 
as Essential Infrastructure in terms of its flood risk vulnerability 
classification (namely ‘electricity generating power stations and grid 
and primary Substations’, Table 2,  NPPF Technical Guidance: Flood 
risk vulnerability classification).  With reference to Table 3 of the NPPF 
(reproduced in Table 4 in Section 2 of this FRA), this type of 
development is classified as appropriate in Flood Zone 1.   
6.1.3 
The Project meets the requirements of the Sequential Test.  
6.2 
The Exception Test 
6.2.1 
With reference to Table 3 of NPPF, the Exception Test does not need 
to be applied to the Project as the development lies within Flood Zone 1 
and passes the Sequential Test, as discussed above.

CONCLUSIONS 
7.1 
Summary of Existing Flood Risk 
7.1.1 
The Project Site is not considered to be at significant risk from any 
source of flooding, namely fluvial, tidal, groundwater, overland flow and 
artificial sources.   
7.1.2 
The greatest risk of flooding to adjacent land is associated with surface 
water runoff, with reported flood incidents within the Eye Airfield 
Industrial Site to the north of the Power Generation Plant Site.  This is 
understood to be as a result of a combination of blocked surface water 
drains within the airfield, blockages within the culverted watercourse 
and also a lack of capacity in the culverted watercourse.  Climate 
change could exacerbate flooding from this source. 
7.2 
Summary of Post-Development Flood Risk 
7.2.1 
Any increase in surface water runoff from the Project Site, including 
that associated with climate change effects, could exacerbate existing 
surface water flood risk within the Eye Airfield Industrial Site and within 
the town of Eye to the south-east.    
7.2.2 
The Power Generation Plant Site will occupy an area of approximately 
7.5 ha.  Up to 1.9 ha of the development will be impermeable, 
comprising buildings, roads and hard standing.  The remaining 5.6 ha 
of this area will remain undeveloped and will therefore remain 
permeable as per current conditions. 
7.2.3 
Preference will be given to the use of infiltration systems for all areas of 
the Project.  If infiltration is unsuitable to manage all surface water 
runoff from the Power Generation Plant Site, the proposed surface 
water drainage strategy is to drain surface water runoff to the existing 
drainage connection located to the north of the site adjacent to Eye 
Power Station.  This drain may discharge to the existing culverted 
watercourse that runs from west to east between the A140 and B1077, 
or it may discharge to the watercourse/highway drain that runs along 
the A140 (noting that this drain may also discharge to the same 
culverted watercourse  as discussed above, or to the west across the 
A140.).  
7.2.4 
The discharge of surface water runoff from the Power Generation Plant 
Site to this existing connection will be attenuated to the existing 
greenfield runoff rate, up to the 1 in 100 year event.  A maximum rate of 
10.11 l/s/ha (19.21 l/s) has been agreed with the EA.  Storage will be 
provided in the form of a detention pond located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site boundary.  Calculations indicate that a maximum

- 64 - 
storage volume of 961 m3 will be required to attenuate flow up to and 
including the 1 in 100 year event and allowing for the potential effects 
of climate change during the lifetime of the development.  
7.2.5 
Where practical, surface water runoff from all impermeable areas of the 
Power Generation Plant Site will be conveyed within open swales, 
ditches and filter strips located adjacent to the proposed access roads.   
7.2.6 
Runoff from low risk areas, such as building roofs and minor access 
roads, will be treated through the use of SUDS techniques.  Runoff 
from high risk areas, such as the lorry/car parking areas and storage 
tanks, will be passed through an oil separator prior to discharge to 
conveyance structures and/or the detention pond.  The separator will 
be designed in accordance with PPG3: Use and Design of Oil 
Separators in Surface Water Drainage Systems.  
7.2.7 
It is proposed that surface water runoff from the ECC and AGI will be 
discharged via infiltration into the ground where feasible. In the case of 
low infiltration rates, connection will be sought into existing surface 
water ditches/drains following consultation with the internal drainage 
board and/or other relevant parties. 
7.2.8 
The proposed access roads will be constructed of tarmac. It is 
proposed that surface water runoff from these routes will runoff to 
adjacent infiltration trenches to be constructed alongside the roads. 
This provides above ground management of surface water in line with 
draft National standards for SUDS and, given the proposed infrequent 
use of these roads, this is deemed to provide adequate treatment of 
surface water runoff. In the event that infiltration is not a viable 
discharge option, alternative methods will be explored that can provide 
combined attenuation and infiltration. This may include an attenuated 
discharge into existing highway drainage in the A140 and Castleton 
Way, although this option will require further consultation and 
agreement with the highways authority.  
7.2.9 
In summary, the proposed surface water drainage system will meet the 
following principles: 
 
No runoff from the development from rainfall depths up to 5 mm; 
 
No increase in the volume or rate of surface water runoff from the 
site in the 1 in 1 and 1 in 100 year rainfall events; 
 
No increase in flooding to people and property elsewhere as a 
result of the development;

 
No surface water flooding within the proposed development in all 
rainfall events up to and including a 1 in 30 year return period 
storm; 
 
Overland flows within the site from rainfall events in exceedence of 
a 1 in 30 year return period storm are to be managed to minimise 
risk to people and property, up to the 1 in 100 year return period 
storm; 
 
The surface water management proposals are to be designed to 
allow for a 10% increase in rainfall intensity in the 1 in 100 year 
rainfall event over the lifetime of the development; 
 
Surface water runoff will be treated through the use of SUDS and 
oil separator.  
7.3 
Flood Defence Consent 
7.3.1 
The Cable and Access Road crosses a drainage ditch approximately 
75 m west of the A140, immediately to the south of Yaxley Lake. The 
Cable also passes beneath a watercourse/highway drain that flows 
adjacent to the A140 (eastern verge). 
7.3.2 
The trench for the Cable will be constructed using below ground 
directional drilling techniques beneath the A140 and adjacent drainage 
ditch. This will not require open excavation.   
7.3.3 
The new Access Road will require the construction of a culvert to 
enable access across the drainage ditch south of Yaxley Lake.  Details 
of the culvert design are unknown at this stage and will be developed 
during the detailed design of the works.  However, the design will 
ensure no impact to the hydraulic capacity of the drainage ditch or the 
hydromorphological, chemical or ecological status of Yaxley Lake.
