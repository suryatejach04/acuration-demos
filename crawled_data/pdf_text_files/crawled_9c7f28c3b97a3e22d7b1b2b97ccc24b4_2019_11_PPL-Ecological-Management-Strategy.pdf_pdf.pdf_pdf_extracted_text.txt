INTRODUCTION  
1.1 
Background  
1.1.1 
This Ecological Management Strategy is prepared to support a Development Consent 
Order (DCO) Application for the Progress Power Project at the former Eye Airfield 
located in Eye, Mid Suffolk, England.  The Project comprises a new Power Generations 
Plant, Electrical Connection and Gas Connection.   
1.1.2 
The Strategy sets out all proposed ecological mitigation measures as detailed in the 
Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) as part of an Environmental Statement (ES) and 
provides a framework for their implementation.  The structure of the document follows 
the structure set out in the ES.  Initially, mitigation proposed for Valued Ecological 
Receptors (VERs) is described with reference made to European Protected Species 
(EPS) where appropriate.  This is followed by a description of mitigation measures 
proposed for the receptors considered for the Natural Features assessment.  
1.1.3 
This Outline Strategy is the precursor to a more detailed Ecological Management Plan 
which will be prepared should the application be successful.   
1.2 
Embedded Design Mitigation 
1.2.1 
The design of the final Project layout has been an iterative process informed by the 
ecological survey results.  The Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey reports (April 20131 
and July 20132), tree bat assessment2 and GCN surveys3 in particular were consulted 
to create an ecological constraints map which was used to inform the final layout.  The 
DCO application boundary was adjusted to avoid direct effects on mature trees (with 
potential to support bats) and waterbodies and the immediate terrestrial habitat suitable 
to support GCN.  As far as possible, the final layout has avoided many habitats and 
features that would likely have been assessed as VERs.

ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY  
2.1 
Valued Ecological Receptors (VERs) 
Statutory Designated Sites 
2.1.1 
Seven sites (Redgrave and Lopham Fens Ramsar, Site of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSI), National Nature Reserve (NNR); Waveney & Little Ouse Valley Fens Special 
Area of Conservation (SAC); Major Farm, Braiseworth SSSI; Gypsy Camp Meadows, 
Thrandeston SSSI; and The Pennings, Eye Local Nature Reserve (LNR)) are 
considered to be VERs for one or more of the species / habitats for which each of the 
sites are designated.   
2.1.2 
No significant construction, operation or decommissioning impacts were identified for 
these VERs and therefore no mitigation measures are required. 
Non-statutory Designated Sites

2.1.3 
All three non-statutory designated sites (Braiseworth Wood / Steggall’s Wood County 
Wildlife Site (CWS), Mellis Common CWS and Thrandeston Marsh CWS) within 2 km 
of the Project Site, are considered to be VERs for one or more of the species / habitats 
for which the sites are designated.   
2.1.4 
Construction impacts in relation to increased levels of noise, vibration and lighting; and 
pollution caused by increased levels of dust, use of hazardous materials and incidental 
release of chemicals, fuels or waste materials will be reduced/avoided through 
measures detailed in the Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP), 
which will be implemented during construction.   
2.1.5 
No significant operation (given the embedded design mitigation of stack heights which 
reduces effects on air quality) or decommissioning impacts were identified and 
therefore no mitigation measures are required. 
Habitat VERs 
2.1.6 
The following habitat types have been identified as VERs in relation to different 
components of the Project: semi-natural broadleaved woodland, species rich hedgerow 
with trees, standing water, species poor intact hedgerow and species poor hedgerow 
with trees.  
2.1.7 
Construction impacts in relation to pollution caused by increased levels of dust, use of 
hazardous materials and incidental release of chemicals, fuels or waste materials will 
be reduced / avoided through measures detailed in the CEMP, which will be 
implemented during construction.   
2.1.8 
Habitat degradation during construction will be mitigated through the demarcation of 
root protection zones within which construction activities will not be undertaken. 
Detailed measures will be agreed as part of the CEMP. 
2.1.9 
Habitat loss during construction will be mitigated through the landscaping strategy for 
the Project, which will incorporate significant hedgerow and woodland habitat planting 
providing a net gain in habitat quantity and quality, and will also improve the green 
infrastructure (habitat connectivity) across the arable landscape.   
2.1.10 
The landscape strategy around the Electrical Connection Compound Site using AIS 
technology will, depending on the final agreed landscaping plans, include the creation 
of approximately 1.6 ha of woodland, 0.5 ha of grassland, 674 m of hedgerow and will 
retain approximately 260 m of existing hedgerow.  The landscape strategy around the 
Electrical Connection Compound Site using GIS technology will include the creation of 
approximately 0.6 ha of woodland, 0.2 ha of grassland, 413 m of hedgerow and will 
retain approximately 510 m of existing hedgerow.  The landscape strategy around the 
Sealing End Compound will lead to the creation of 0.04 ha of grassland and 166 m of 
hedgerow.  The landscape strategy around the Power Generation Plant will lead to the 
creation of 0.7 ha woodland and 0.1 ha scrub.  The landscape strategy around the 
Above Ground Installation will lead to the creation of 0.5 ha woodland and 245 m of 
hedgerow. 
2.1.11 
Standing water will be subject to habitat loss localised to a very small section of the 
existing ditch along the Access Road.  This is required to facilitate the slightly wider 
Access Road (in comparison with the existing track).  The loss of the small section of 
the wet ditch is not considered to be significant as the integrity of the waterbody will not 
be affected and works will be very localised.  The disturbance in the form of increased 
dust levels from construction and pollution from incidental release of chemicals, fuels

or waste materials and will be mitigated through the implementation of the CEMP.  A 
surface water retention pond will be created within the Power Generation Plant Site 
which will compensate for the small localised reduction in size of the wet ditch on a 
Project level.   
2.1.12 
During operation only standing water could potentially be affected by pollution however 
the road drainage design will not allow road drainage to enter Yaxley Lake therefore 
impacts will be avoided.    
2.1.13 
Decommissioning impacts would be eliminated through the implementation of an 
Environmental Management Plan which will avoid/minimise generation of excessive 
litter, dust, noise and vibration and will prevent accidental pollution of adjacent habitats.  
Monitoring will ensure the measures are effective.  These measures will be in line with 
latest guidance and legislative requirements in force at the time of decommissioning. 
Species VERs 
Brown hare – Priority species 
2.1.14 
Construction will result in habitat loss and fragmentation for brown hare and will be 
mitigated through the landscaping strategy for the Project which will incorporate 
significant hedgerow and woodland habitat planting providing a net gain in habitat 
quality, and will also improve the green infrastructure (habitat connectivity) across the 
arable landscape. Construction impacts will also be minimised through the 
implementation of a CEMP. 
2.1.15 
Disturbance from operational activities including visual, and lighting will be mitigated 
through the lighting scheme for the Project which will ensure minimal light spillage and 
directional lighting therefore ensuring that compensatory habitat is not lit and is suitable 
for use as commuting and refuge for wildlife.  The general design principles that will be 
used to minimise the impact on key lighting receptors and to meet environmental 
requirements are: 
2.1.16 
To design for optimal light levels which provide enough illumination to safely undertake 
operational activities while limiting their impact on sensitive receptors; 
2.1.17 
To locate significant sources of lighting away from sensitive landscape and ecological 
receptors; 
2.1.18 
To include full cut-off luminaires to prevent upward light with shields and baffles that 
can be directed downwards rather than horizontally to limit light pollution onto sensitive 
areas; 
2.1.19 
To use columns of a minimum height.  When lighting large areas preference would be 
given to several lower units rather than tall wide beam lighting units to limit light 
trespass, glare and sky glow; 
2.1.20 
To use controls to avoid unnecessary illumination and to ensure efficient luminaires are 
used; 
2.1.21 
Further details are set out in the outline lighting principles strategy 
2.1.22 
Decommissioning impacts would be eliminated through the implementation of an 
Environmental Management Plan which will avoid/minimise generation of excessive 
litter, dust, noise and vibration and will prevent accidental pollution of adjacent habitats.

In addition work locations (including accesses) will be designed to avoid/minimise 
impacts.  Monitoring will ensure the measures are effective.  These measures will be in 
line with latest guidance and legislative requirements in force at the time of 
decommissioning.   
Foraging and commuting bats – European Protected Species 
2.1.23 
Construction will result in habitat loss and fragmentation for foraging and commuting 
bats and will be mitigated through the landscaping strategy for the Project.  The 
landscaping strategy will incorporate significant hedgerow and woodland habitat 
planting providing a net gain in habitat quality, and will also improve the green 
infrastructure (habitat connectivity) across the arable landscape. Construction impacts 
will also be minimised through the implementation of a CEMP. 
2.1.24 
Disturbance from operational activities including visual, and lighting will be mitigated 
through the lighting scheme for the Project.  The lighting scheme will ensure minimal 
lighting across the Project essential for safety and security.  All external lighting 
columns will be fitted with baffles, cowls or louvres to direct the light to where it is 
needed and minimise light spillage.  None of the compensatory habitat planting will be 
lit, in order for the new habitat to be functional as foraging and commuting habitat.  
Lighting principles are identified above, and in the outline lighting principles strategy. 
2.1.25 
Decommissioning impacts would be eliminated through the implementation of an 
Environmental Management Plan which will avoid/minimise generation of excessive 
litter, dust, noise and vibration and will prevent accidental pollution of adjacent habitats.  
In addition work locations (including accesses) will be designed to avoid/minimise 
impacts.  Monitoring will ensure the measures are effective.  These measures will be in 
line with latest guidance and legislative requirements in force at the time of 
decommissioning.   
Breeding birds  
2.1.26 
Construction will result in habitat loss and fragmentation for breeding birds and will be 
mitigated through the landscaping strategy for the Project.  The landscaping strategy 
will incorporate significant hedgerow and woodland habitat planting providing a net gain 
in habitat quality, and will also improve the green infrastructure (habitat connectivity) 
across the arable landscape.  It is acknowledged that a net loss of arable land will occur 
however this is not considered to be limiting factor to the breeding bird assemblages 
(including skylarks a priority species) given the availability of this habitat in the wider 
area (ES 8.11.58).  The parties remain in discussion over the need for offsite 
mitigation/compensatory measures for this species and the EMS will be updated 
accordingly. 
 
2.1.27 
Disturbance to breeding birds will be reduced through the implementation of the 
following measures: 
 
All clearance works will be undertaken outside the nesting season thereby 
reducing disturbance to active bird nests.  This is widely considered to be from 
March to August inclusive, but can vary depending on the species and / or 
seasonal conditions.  Where vegetation cannot be removed outside of the nesting 
season, pre-clearance checks will be undertaken by an experienced ecologist to 
identify if any birds are nesting within or close to the vegetation due to be removed.  
An informed decision would then be made if the vegetation clearance can be

undertaken.  If a bird nest is found, it must be left in-situ and protected from works; 
no works can be undertaken in that area until the young birds have fledged from 
the nest site.  This may take several weeks and will vary depending on the species.  
 
All construction works will be taking place between 07:00 and 19:00 hours which 
will limit the impact to roosting birds.  All construction related lighting will be 
designed and fitted to minimise any adverse impacts on the retained surrounding 
vegetation.  Such measures include the use of hoods and cowls and directional 
lighting away from features such as hedgerows and scrub.   
2.1.28 
Disturbance from operational activities including visual, noise and lighting will be 
mitigated through the lighting scheme for the Project.  The lighting scheme will ensure 
minimal lighting across the Project essential for safety and security.  All external lighting 
columns will be fitted with baffles, cowls or louvres to direct the light to where it is

Wintering birds  
2.1.30 
Construction will result in habitat loss and fragmentation for wintering birds and will be 
mitigated through the landscaping strategy for the Project.  The landscaping strategy  
will incorporate significant hedgerow and woodland habitat planting providing a net gain 
in habitat quality, and will also improve the green infrastructure (habitat connectivity) 
across the arable landscape. 
2.1.31 
All construction related lighting will be designed and fitted to minimise any adverse 
impacts on the retained surrounding vegetation.  Such measures include the use of 
hoods and cowls and directional lighting away from features such as hedgerows and 
scrub.  In addition the Cable and Pipeline components of the project will be built during 
the spring and summer and therefore will avoid impacts on wintering bird assemblages.   
2.1.32 
Disturbance from operational activities including visual, noise and lighting will be 
mitigated through the lighting scheme for the Project.  The lighting scheme will ensure 
minimal lighting across the Project essential for safety and security.  All external lighting 
columns will be fitted with baffles, cowls or louvres to direct the light to where it is 
needed and minimise light spillage.  None of the compensatory habitat planting will be 
lit, in order for the new habitat to be functional as foraging and commuting habitat.

2.1.34 
The assessment in the ES is based on the realistic worst case scenario whereby the 
presence of medium GCN population was assumed present in all suitable waterbodies 
and terrestrial habitat.   
2.1.35 
As referred to in the ES, further great crested newt presence/absence surveys were 
undertaken in 2014 and the survey results are presented in the Great Crested Newt 
Survey Report: Progress Power Project June 2014 report.   
2.1.36 
As part of this work a total of 44 water bodies situated within 500 m of the project site 
were subject to a Habitat Suitability Index (H.S.I) assessment in March 2014.  Following 
the H.S.I assessment a total of 22 ponds were considered for further GCN 
presence/absence surveys.  These include ponds: 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 23, 24, 
25, E23, E25, E26, E27, E28, E29, E35, E38, E39 and E45.  In total 17 ponds could be 
surveyed in 2014 (five could not be accessed – these were, however, located over 250 
m from the boundary of the Power Generation Plant component of the Proposed 
Development).  Likely absence of GCN was established in all ponds subject to survey.  
2.1.37 
The geographical coverage of the survey data indicates that likely absence was 
established within 500 m of the Electrical Connection and Gas Connection components 
of the Proposed Development.  In accordance with the likely absence of GCN in this 
area no impacts are envisaged on GCN in relation to the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Electrical Connection and Gas Connection components of the 
Proposed Development.  The mitigation previously detailed in relation to this species in 
the ES (on a precautionary basis) will still be implemented and as such it is considered 
that this will likely lead to a net biodiversity gain for a range of other species.    
2.1.38 
The water bodies in cluster 1, 2, 3, 18 and 25 could not be accessed for GCN survey 
in 2014.  This cluster is situated within 500 m but more than 250 m from the boundary 
of the Power Generation Plant component of the Proposed Development.  Given the 
distance of the Power Generation Plant site to the ponds and the size of the area 
affected, the Proposed Development is considered to result in an amber ‘offence likely’ 
risk level if GCN were present.  However, in line with the guidelines, it is considered 
that with additional non-licensed avoidance measures implemented, the risk can be 
reduced to a negligible level and works may proceed under a non licensed method 
statement.   
2.1.39 
When considering the risk to the GCN population potentially present within the water 
body cluster additional consideration must be given to: 
 
habitat quality and type (arable field and the small amount of grassland both 
present low suitability for GCN);  
 
likely dispersal corridors (no suitable breeding ponds are present within 500 m of 
the ponds not subject to 2014 survey in the direction of the Power Generation Plant 
site which would encourage GCN movement across and into the site; the habitat 
present dictates that the likely movement of the GCN population would be focused 
to the north and west away from the Power Generation Plant); 
 
barriers to movement (the area directly between the water body cluster (ponds 1, 
2, 3, 18 and 25) and the Power Generation Plant site consists almost entirely of 
handstanding more than 200 m wide and is considered a barrier to GCN 
movement; the closest possible route across non-hardstanding habitat is via the 
arable land more than 350 m away and includes the 30-40 m wide former runway 
as a barrier to GCN movement).

 
In addition to the above, one pond within the cluster had previously been surveyed 
in 2013 with likely absence established. 
2.1.40 
Based on the above information it is considered that should GCN be present in the 
cluster of ponds where access for survey was not possible in 2014, it is highly unlikely 
that they would be using the Power Generation Plant site and therefore the risk of 
committing an offence is significantly reduced.  Therefore, the need for a mitigation 
licence in relation to the Proposed Development is not considered necessary, given the 
low risk of committing an offence.  The residual low risk will be managed through the 
implementation of a site specific Method Statement which will be developed in 
conjunction with the main contractor.  
2.1.41 
The Method Statement should contain the following principles: 
 
In instances where there is a risk to GCN, then supervision of vegetation 
clearance will be undertaken by an Ecological Clerk of Works. 
 
In instances where there is a risk to GCN,, backfill trenches and other 
excavations before nightfall,  leave a ramp to allow newts to easily exit or 
consider alternative measures in consultation with the ECoW. 
 
Raise stored materials (that might act as temporary resting places) off the 
ground, e.g. on pallets. 
 
If GCN are found to be present within the development site, all works must stop 
immediately and specialist advice sought from ECoW. 
 
Details for construction of amphibian hibernacula 
2.1.42 
The landscape strategy will lead to a net gain in both the quality and quantity of 
available suitable GCN terrestrial habitat.  It will also maintain habitat connectivity.  
Specific habitat features will also be provided, including the creation of at least two 
purpose-built hibernacula.  Please note that the landscape strategy will be put in place 
even if GCN are not present.   
2.1.43 
During operation only suitable breeding ponds (standing water) could potentially be 
affected by pollution however the Project drainage will be designed so that there is no 
risk of run-off or contamination into surrounding waterbodies or other habitats (a 
standard requirement of the Environment Agency).   
2.1.44 
Decommissioning impacts would be eliminated through the implementation of an 
Environmental Management Plan which will avoid/minimise generation of excessive 
litter, dust, noise and vibration and will prevent accidental pollution of adjacent habitats.  
In addition work locations (including accesses) will be designed to avoid/minimise 
impacts.  Monitoring will ensure the measures are effective.  These measures will be in 
line with latest guidance and legislative requirements in force at the time of 
decommissioning.

Natural Features Receptors 
2.3.1 
In addition to the assessment of significant effects presented in the ES, it is also 
necessary to consider all potential effects on natural features, not just those effects 
which are significant in EIA terms.   
Statutory Designated Sites 
2.3.2 
The six designated sites within 10 km of the Project Site (Burgate Wood SSSI, Hoxne 
Brick Pit SSSI, Wortham Ling SSSI, Shelfanger Meadows SSSI, Westhall Wood & 
Meadow SSSI and Royden Fen LNR) are considered to be outside the zone of 
influence of potential air quality impacts and no other pathways of potential impact are 
present, therefore no mitigation measures are considered necessary.  
Habitat Receptors  
2.3.3 
The following habitat types have been identified as Receptors in relation to different 
components of the Project: dense scrub, scattered scrub, broadleaved scattered trees, 
poor semi-improved grassland, standing water, arable and dry ditch.   
2.3.4 
Impacts on habitats are envisaged to be habitat loss and fragmentation which will be 
mitigated through the landscaping strategy for the Project.  The landscaping strategy 
will incorporate significant hedgerow and woodland habitat planting providing a net gain 
in habitat quality and quantity, and will also improve the green infrastructure (habitat 
connectivity) across the arable landscape.  Some grassland planting will also be 
included in the landscape strategy.   
2.3.5 
Habitats subject to disturbance in the form of increased dust levels from construction 
and pollution from incidental release of chemicals, fuels or waste materials and will be 
mitigated through the implementation of the CEMP.   
2.3.6 
In addition earth bank, buildings and hardstanding were also present however given 
their limited nature conservation value no mitigation was considered necessary.   
Badgers 
2.3.7 
No setts or evidence of use were recorded, however the Project Site may occasionally 
be used for dispersal.  No direct impacts are envisaged on this species, however 
badgers are present in the wider area and may colonise the Project Site.  Mitigation for 
this will consist of a re-survey for badgers of the Project Site prior to construction 
activities proceeding. 
Roosting bats 
2.3.8 
No suitable roosting habitat was recorded within Project Site, however potential 
roosting site are situated outside the Project Site which could be subject to disturbance 
from construction activities including visual, noise and lighting and will be mitigated 
through the implementation of the CEMP.   
Reptiles  
2.3.9 
Surveys revealed one incidental sighting of grass snake north of Project Site and given 
the highly mobile nature of this species their presence is assumed in all suitable 
habitats within the Project Site.  Suitable reptile habitat will be lost during the 
construction of the Project and vegetation clearance works could kill or injure reptile

species.  This will be mitigated through supervision by an Ecological Clerk of Works 
and sensitive vegetation cutting prior to Construction.  Landscaping proposals will 
create suitable reptile habitat.

DELIVERY MECHANISM  
3.1 
Construction  
3.1.1 
Mitigation will be implemented as per the contract of works with the Main Contractor, 
and are likely to include the CEMP, compliance with Pollution Prevention Guidelines, 
installation of physical site boundary barriers, lighting scheme, Soil Management and 
Habitat Restoration Strategy, Pre-construction survey for badgers, and Reptile Method 
Statement. 
3.1.2 
An Ecological Clerk of Works will be appointed for the duration of the Construction 
works and this will ensure that all necessary ecological mitigation measures identified 
and method statements are implemented and pre-construction species surveys are 
undertaken.   
3.1.3 
Meetings with the relevant Local Authorities will be held to update on ecological survey 
findings and mitigation measures.  The details of reporting and meetings with the 
relevant Local Authorities will be agreed as part of the Ecological Management Plan 
which will be submitted under draft DCO Requirement 10  
3.1.4 
The mitigation will be implemented before and during construction and will be a DCO 
Requirement.  Implementation of the CEMP and the other measures during 
construction will be the responsibility of the Main Contractor. 
3.2 
Operation  
3.2.1 
During operation two mitigation measures are proposed: a lighting scheme to reduce 
disturbance from operational lighting and a drainage design to avoid pollution of 
waterbodies.  Both will provide for ongoing maintenance activities and will be 
implemented by the site staff operating on site at the time.     
 
3.3 
Decommissioning  
3.3.1 
The implementation of a Decommissioning Environmental Management Plan will be 
completed as per the contract of works by the Main Contractor.  Monitoring will ensure 
the measures are effective.  These measures and responsibilities will be in line with 
latest guidance and legislative requirements in force at the time of decommissioning.  
Baseline conditions (including identification of VERs, impact assessment and suitable 
mitigation measures) will need to be re-assessed before decommissioning.
