Introduction
This Report responds to the invitation for IPCC ‘... to provide a Special Report in 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways’ contained in the Decision of the 21st Conference 
of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to adopt the Paris Agreement.1
The IPCC accepted the invitation in April 2016, deciding to prepare this Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global 
response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty.
This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) presents the key findings of the Special Report, based on the assessment of the available 
scientific, technical and socio-economic literature2 relevant to global warming of 1.5°C and for the comparison between global 
warming of 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The level of confidence associated with each key finding is reported using 
the IPCC calibrated language.3 The underlying scientific basis of each key finding is indicated by references provided to chapter 
elements. In the SPM, knowledge gaps are identified associated with the underlying chapters of the Report.
A. Understanding Global Warming of 1.5°C
4
A.1 
Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming5 above 
pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C 
between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. (high confidence) (Figure 
SPM.1) {1.2}
A.1.1 
Reflecting the long-term warming trend since pre-industrial times, observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) for 
the decade 2006–2015 was 0.87°C (likely between 0.75°C and 0.99°C)6 higher than the average over the 1850–1900 
period (very high confidence). Estimated anthropogenic global warming matches the level of observed warming to within 
±20% (likely range). Estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2°C (likely between 0.1°C and 
0.3°C) per decade due to past and ongoing emissions (high confidence). {1.2.1, Table 1.1, 1.2.4}
A.1.2 
Warming greater than the global annual average is being experienced in many land regions and seasons, including two to 
three times higher in the Arctic. Warming is generally higher over land than over the ocean. (high confidence) {1.2.1, 1.2.2, 
Figure 1.1, Figure 1.3, 3.3.1, 3.3.2}
A.1.3 
Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes have been detected over time spans during which 
about 0.5°C of global warming occurred (medium confidence). This assessment is based on several lines of evidence, 
including attribution studies for changes in extremes since 1950. {3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3} 
1 Decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 21.
2 The assessment covers literature accepted for publication by 15 May 2018.
3 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and  
 
typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100%  
 
probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely  
 
95–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, more unlikely than likely 0–<50%, extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics,  
 
for example, very likely. This is consistent with AR5. 
4 See also Box SPM.1: Core Concepts Central to this Special Report.
5 Present level of global warming is defined as the average of a 30-year period centred on 2017 assuming the recent rate of warming continues.
6 This range spans the four available peer-reviewed estimates of the observed GMST change and also accounts for additional uncertainty due to possible short-term natural variability.

A.2 
Warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the present will persist for 
centuries to millennia and will continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, 
such as sea level rise, with associated impacts (high confidence), but these emissions alone are 
unlikely to cause global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.1) {1.2, 3.3, Figure 1.5}
A.2.1 
Anthropogenic emissions (including greenhouse gases, aerosols and their precursors) up to the present are unlikely to 
cause further warming of more than 0.5°C over the next two to three decades (high confidence) or on a century time scale 
(medium confidence). {1.2.4, Figure 1.5}
A.2.2 
Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic CO2 emissions and declining net non-CO2 radiative forcing would 
halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal time scales (high confidence). The maximum temperature reached is 
then determined by cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions up to the time of net zero CO2 emissions (high 
confidence) and the level of non-CO2 radiative forcing in the decades prior to the time that maximum temperatures are 
reached (medium confidence). On longer time scales, sustained net negative global anthropogenic CO2 emissions and/
or further reductions in non-CO2 radiative forcing may still be required to prevent further warming due to Earth system 
feedbacks and to reverse ocean acidification (medium confidence) and will be required to minimize sea level rise (high 
confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1, 1.2.3, 1.2.4, Figure 1.4, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 3.4.4.8, 3.4.5.1, 3.6.3.2}
A.3 
Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than 
at present, but lower than at 2°C (high confidence). These risks depend on the magnitude and rate 
of warming, geographic location, levels of development and vulnerability, and on the choices and 
implementation of adaptation and mitigation options (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {1.3, 3.3, 
3.4, 5.6}
A.3.1 
Impacts on natural and human systems from global warming have already been observed (high confidence). Many land and 
ocean ecosystems and some of the services they provide have already changed due to global warming (high confidence). 
(Figure SPM.2) {1.4, 3.4, 3.5}
A.3.2 
Future climate-related risks depend on the rate, peak and duration of warming. In the aggregate, they are larger if global 
warming exceeds 1.5°C before returning to that level by 2100 than if global warming gradually stabilizes at 1.5°C, especially 
if the peak temperature is high (e.g., about 2°C) (high confidence). Some impacts may be long-lasting or irreversible, such 
as the loss of some ecosystems (high confidence). {3.2, 3.4.4, 3.6.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}
A.3.3 
Adaptation and mitigation are already occurring (high confidence). Future climate-related risks would be reduced by the 
upscaling and acceleration of far-reaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral climate mitigation and by both incremental and 
transformational adaptation (high confidence). {1.2, 1.3, Table 3.5, 4.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Box 4.2, Box 
4.3, Box 4.6, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.3.5, 4.4.1, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, 4.5.3}

of warming continues. The grey plume on the right of panel a shows the likely range of warming responses, computed with a simple climate model, to a stylized 
pathway (hypothetical future) in which net CO2 emissions (grey line in panels b and c) decline in a straight line from 2020 to reach net zero in 2055 and net non-
CO2 radiative forcing (grey line in panel d) increases to 2030 and then declines. The blue plume in panel a) shows the response to faster CO2 emissions reductions 
(blue line in panel b), reaching net zero in 2040, reducing cumulative CO2 emissions (panel c). The purple plume shows the response to net CO2 emissions declining 
to zero in 2055, with net non-CO2 forcing remaining constant after 2030. The vertical error bars on right of panel a) show the likely ranges (thin lines) and central 
terciles (33rd – 66th percentiles, thick lines) of the estimated distribution of warming in 2100 under these three stylized pathways. Vertical dotted error bars in

Projected Climate Change, Potential Impacts and Associated Risks
B.1 
Climate models project robust7 differences in regional climate characteristics between present-day 
and global warming of 1.5°C,8 and between 1.5°C and 2°C.8 These differences include increases 
in: mean temperature in most land and ocean regions (high confidence), hot extremes in most 
inhabited regions (high confidence), heavy precipitation in several regions (medium confidence), 
and the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions (medium confidence). 
{3.3}
B.1.1 
Evidence from attributed changes in some climate and weather extremes for a global warming of about 0.5°C supports 
the assessment that an additional 0.5°C of warming compared to present is associated with further detectable changes in 
these extremes (medium confidence). Several regional changes in climate are assessed to occur with global warming up 
to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels, including warming of extreme temperatures in many regions (high confidence), 
increases in frequency, intensity, and/or amount of heavy precipitation in several regions (high confidence), and an increase 
in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions (medium confidence). {3.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Table 3.2}
B.1.2 
Temperature extremes on land are projected to warm more than GMST (high confidence): extreme hot days in mid-latitudes 
warm by up to about 3°C at global warming of 1.5°C and about 4°C at 2°C, and extreme cold nights in high latitudes warm 
by up to about 4.5°C at 1.5°C and about 6°C at 2°C (high confidence). The number of hot days is projected to increase in 
most land regions, with highest increases in the tropics (high confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}
B.1.3 
Risks from droughts and precipitation deficits are projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming in 
some regions (medium confidence). Risks from heavy precipitation events are projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 
1.5°C of global warming in several northern hemisphere high-latitude and/or high-elevation regions, eastern Asia and 
eastern North America (medium confidence). Heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones is projected to be 
higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C global warming (medium confidence). There is generally low confidence in projected 
changes in heavy precipitation at 2°C compared to 1.5°C in other regions. Heavy precipitation when aggregated at global 
scale is projected to be higher at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). As a consequence of heavy 
precipitation, the fraction of the global land area affected by flood hazards is projected to be larger at 2°C compared to 
1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.3.6}
B.2 
By 2100, global mean sea level rise is projected to be around 0.1 metre lower with global warming 
of 1.5°C compared to 2°C (medium confidence). Sea level will continue to rise well beyond 2100 
(high confidence), and the magnitude and rate of this rise depend on future emission pathways. 
A slower rate of sea level rise enables greater opportunities for adaptation in the human and 
ecological systems of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas (medium confidence). 
{3.3, 3.4, 3.6}
B.2.1 
Model-based projections of global mean sea level rise (relative to 1986–2005) suggest an indicative range of 0.26 to 0.77 
m by 2100 for 1.5°C of global warming, 0.1 m (0.04–0.16 m) less than for a global warming of 2°C (medium confidence). 
A reduction of 0.1 m in global sea level rise implies that up to 10 million fewer people would be exposed to related risks, 
based on population in the year 2010 and assuming no adaptation (medium confidence). {3.4.4, 3.4.5, 4.3.2}
B.2.2 
Sea level rise will continue beyond 2100 even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C in the 21st century (high confidence). 
Marine ice sheet instability in Antarctica and/or irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet could result in multi-metre rise 
in sea level over hundreds to thousands of years. These instabilities could be triggered at around 1.5°C to 2°C of global 
warming (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {3.3.9, 3.4.5, 3.5.2, 3.6.3, Box 3.3}
7 Robust is here used to mean that at least two thirds of climate models show the same sign of changes at the grid point scale, and that differences in large regions are statistically  
 
significant.
8 Projected changes in impacts between different levels of global warming are determined with respect to changes in global mean surface air temperature.

B.2.3 
Increasing warming amplifies the exposure of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas to the risks associated with 
sea level rise for many human and ecological systems, including increased saltwater intrusion, flooding and damage to 
infrastructure (high confidence). Risks associated with sea level rise are higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C. The slower rate 
of sea level rise at global warming of 1.5°C reduces these risks, enabling greater opportunities for adaptation including 
managing and restoring natural coastal ecosystems and infrastructure reinforcement (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2) 
{3.4.5, Box 3.5}
B.3 
On land, impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, including species loss and extinction, are 
projected to be lower at 1.5°C of global warming compared to 2°C. Limiting global warming to 
1.5°C compared to 2°C is projected to lower the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal 
ecosystems and to retain more of their services to humans (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2) 
{3.4, 3.5, Box 3.4, Box 4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3} 
B.3.1 
Of 105,000 species studied,9 6% of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates are projected to lose over half of their 
climatically determined geographic range for global warming of 1.5°C, compared with 18% of insects, 16% of plants and 
8% of vertebrates for global warming of 2°C (medium confidence). Impacts associated with other biodiversity-related 
risks such as forest fires and the spread of invasive species are lower at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of global warming (high 
confidence). {3.4.3, 3.5.2}
B.3.2 
Approximately 4% (interquartile range 2–7%) of the global terrestrial land area is projected to undergo a transformation 
of ecosystems from one type to another at 1°C of global warming, compared with 13% (interquartile range 8–20%) at 2°C 
(medium confidence). This indicates that the area at risk is projected to be approximately 50% lower at 1.5°C compared to 
2°C (medium confidence). {3.4.3.1, 3.4.3.5}
B.3.3 
High-latitude tundra and boreal forests are particularly at risk of climate change-induced degradation and loss, with woody 
shrubs already encroaching into the tundra (high confidence) and this will proceed with further warming. Limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C is projected to prevent the thawing over centuries of a permafrost area in the range of 
1.5 to 2.5 million km2 (medium confidence). {3.3.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.5} 
B.4 
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C is projected to reduce increases in ocean 
temperature as well as associated increases in ocean acidity and decreases in ocean oxygen levels 
(high confidence). Consequently, limiting global warming to 1.5°C is projected to reduce risks 
to marine biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystems, and their functions and services to humans, 
as illustrated by recent changes to Arctic sea ice and warm-water coral reef ecosystems (high 
confidence). {3.3, 3.4, 3.5, Box 3.4, Box 3.5}
B.4.1 
There is high confidence that the probability of a sea ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer is substantially lower at global 
warming of 1.5°C when compared to 2°C. With 1.5°C of global warming, one sea ice-free Arctic summer is projected per 
century. This likelihood is increased to at least one per decade with 2°C global warming. Effects of a temperature overshoot 
are reversible for Arctic sea ice cover on decadal time scales (high confidence). {3.3.8, 3.4.4.7}
B.4.2 
Global warming of 1.5°C is projected to shift the ranges of many marine species to higher latitudes as well as increase the 
amount of damage to many ecosystems. It is also expected to drive the loss of coastal resources and reduce the productivity of 
fisheries and aquaculture (especially at low latitudes). The risks of climate-induced impacts are projected to be higher at 2°C 
than those at global warming of 1.5°C (high confidence). Coral reefs, for example, are projected to decline by a further 70–90% 
at 1.5°C (high confidence) with larger losses (>99%) at 2°C (very high confidence). The risk of irreversible loss of many marine 
and coastal ecosystems increases with global warming, especially at 2°C or more (high confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}
9 Consistent with earlier studies, illustrative numbers were adopted from one recent meta-study.

10 Here, impacts on economic growth refer to changes in gross domestic product (GDP). Many impacts, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage and ecosystem services, are difficult 
to value and monetize.
B.4.3 
The level of ocean acidification due to increasing CO2 concentrations associated with global warming of 1.5°C is projected to 
amplify the adverse effects of warming, and even further at 2°C, impacting the growth, development, calcification, survival, 
and thus abundance of a broad range of species, for example, from algae to fish (high confidence). {3.3.10, 3.4.4}
B.4.4 
Impacts of climate change in the ocean are increasing risks to fisheries and aquaculture via impacts on the physiology, 
survivorship, habitat, reproduction, disease incidence, and risk of invasive species (medium confidence) but are projected to 
be less at 1.5°C of global warming than at 2°C. One global fishery model, for example, projected a decrease in global annual 
catch for marine fisheries of about 1.5 million tonnes for 1.5°C of global warming compared to a loss of more than 3 million 
tonnes for 2°C of global warming (medium confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}
B.5 
Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and 
economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 
2°C. (Figure SPM.2) {3.4, 3.5, 5.2, Box 3.2, Box 3.3, Box 3.5, Box 3.6, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 
3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5, 5.2} 
B.5.1 
Populations at disproportionately higher risk of adverse consequences with global warming of 1.5°C and beyond include 
disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, some indigenous peoples, and local communities dependent on agricultural or 
coastal livelihoods (high confidence). Regions at disproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, 
small island developing states, and Least Developed Countries (high confidence). Poverty and disadvantage are expected 
to increase in some populations as global warming increases; limiting global warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, could 
reduce the number of people both exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by up to several hundred 
million by 2050 (medium confidence). {3.4.10, 3.4.11, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in 
Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5, 4.2.2.2, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.6.3}
B.5.2 
Any increase in global warming is projected to affect human health, with primarily negative consequences (high confidence). 
Lower risks are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C for heat-related morbidity and mortality (very high confidence) and for 
ozone-related mortality if emissions needed for ozone formation remain high (high confidence). Urban heat islands often 
amplify the impacts of heatwaves in cities (high confidence). Risks from some vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and 
dengue fever, are projected to increase with warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, including potential shifts in their geographic range 
(high confidence). {3.4.7, 3.4.8, 3.5.5.8}
B.5.3 
Limiting warming to 1.5°C compared with 2°C is projected to result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat, 
and potentially other cereal crops, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America, and 
in the CO2-dependent nutritional quality of rice and wheat (high confidence). Reductions in projected food availability are 
larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming in the Sahel, southern Africa, the Mediterranean, central Europe, and the 
Amazon (medium confidence). Livestock are projected to be adversely affected with rising temperatures, depending on the 
extent of changes in feed quality, spread of diseases, and water resource availability (high confidence). {3.4.6, 3.5.4, 3.5.5, 
Box 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}
B.5.4 
Depending on future socio-economic conditions, limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C may reduce the 
proportion of the world population exposed to a climate change-induced increase in water stress by up to 50%, although 
there is considerable variability between regions (medium confidence). Many small island developing states could  
experience lower water stress as a result of projected changes in aridity when global warming is limited to 1.5°C, as 
compared to 2°C (medium confidence). {3.3.5, 3.4.2, 3.4.8, 3.5.5, Box 3.2, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}
B.5.5 
Risks to global aggregated economic growth due to climate change impacts are projected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 
2°C by the end of this century10 (medium confidence). This excludes the costs of mitigation, adaptation investments and 
the benefits of adaptation. Countries in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics are projected to experience the 
largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase from 1.5°C to 2°C (medium 
confidence). {3.5.2, 3.5.3}

B.5.6 
Exposure to multiple and compound climate-related risks increases between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, with greater 
proportions of people both so exposed and susceptible to poverty in Africa and Asia (high confidence). For global warming 
from 1.5°C to 2°C, risks across energy, food, and water sectors could overlap spatially and temporally, creating new and 
exacerbating current hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities that could affect increasing numbers of people and regions 
(medium confidence). {Box 3.5, 3.3.1, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.6, 3.4.11, 3.5.4.9}
B.5.7 
There are multiple lines of evidence that since AR5 the assessed levels of risk increased for four of the five Reasons for 
Concern (RFCs) for global warming to 2°C (high confidence). The risk transitions by degrees of global warming are now: 
from high to very high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC1 (Unique and threatened systems) (high confidence); from 
moderate to high risk between 1°C and 1.5°C for RFC2 (Extreme weather events) (medium confidence); from moderate to 
high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC3 (Distribution of impacts) (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between 
1.5°C and 2.5°C for RFC4 (Global aggregate impacts) (medium confidence); and from moderate to high risk between 1°C 
and 2.5°C for RFC5 (Large-scale singular events) (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {3.4.13; 3.5, 3.5.2}
B.6  
Most adaptation needs will be lower for global warming of 1.5°C compared to 2°C (high confidence). 
There are a wide range of adaptation options that can reduce the risks of climate change (high 
confidence). There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and natural 
systems at global warming of 1.5°C, with associated losses (medium confidence). The number and 
availability of adaptation options vary by sector (medium confidence). {Table 3.5, 4.3, 4.5, Cross-
Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5} 
B.6.1 
A wide range of adaptation options are available to reduce the risks to natural and managed ecosystems (e.g., ecosystem-
based adaptation, ecosystem restoration and avoided degradation and deforestation, biodiversity management, 
sustainable aquaculture, and local knowledge and indigenous knowledge), the risks of sea level rise (e.g., coastal defence 
and hardening), and the risks to health, livelihoods, food, water, and economic growth, especially in rural landscapes 
(e.g., efficient irrigation, social safety nets, disaster risk management, risk spreading and sharing, and community-
based adaptation) and urban areas (e.g., green infrastructure, sustainable land use and planning, and sustainable water 
management) (medium confidence). {4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.5, 4.5.3, 4.5.4, 5.3.2, Box 4.2, Box 4.3, Box 4.6, Cross-Chapter 
Box 9 in Chapter 4}.
B.6.2 
Adaptation is expected to be more challenging for ecosystems, food and health systems at 2°C of global warming than for 
1.5°C (medium confidence). Some vulnerable regions, including small islands and Least Developed Countries, are projected 
to experience high multiple interrelated climate risks even at global warming of 1.5°C (high confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4.5, 
Box 3.5, Table 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, 5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5, Box 5.3}
B.6.3 
Limits to adaptive capacity exist at 1.5°C of global warming, become more pronounced at higher levels of warming and 
vary by sector, with site-specific implications for vulnerable regions, ecosystems and human health (medium confidence).

Five integrative reasons for concern (RFCs) provide a framework for summarizing key impacts and risks across sectors and regions, and were 
introduced in the IPCC Third Assessment Report. RFCs illustrate the implications of global warming for people, economies and ecosystems. Impacts and/or risks 
for each RFC are based on assessment of the new literature that has appeared. As in AR5, this literature was used to make expert judgments to assess the levels 
of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable, moderate, high or very high. The selection of impacts and risks to natural, managed and 
human systems in the lower panel is illustrative and is not intended to be fully comprehensive. {3.4, 3.5, 3.5.2.1, 3.5.2.2, 3.5.2.3, 3.5.2.4, 3.5.2.5, 5.4.1, 5.5.3, 
5.6.1, Box 3.4}
RFC1 Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and 
have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its indigenous people, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. 
RFC2 Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heat waves, heavy rain, 
drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. 
RFC3 Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, 
exposure or vulnerability. 
RFC4 Global aggregate impacts: global monetary damage, global-scale degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. 
RFC5 Large-scale singular events: are relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems that are caused by global warming. Examples 
include disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

Summary for Policymakers

11 References to pathways limiting global warming to 2°C are based on a 66% probability of staying below 2°C.
12 Non-CO2 emissions included in this Report are all anthropogenic emissions other than CO2 that result in radiative forcing. These include short-lived climate forcers, such as methane,  
 
some fluorinated gases, ozone precursors, aerosols or aerosol precursors, such as black carbon and sulphur dioxide, respectively, as well as long-lived greenhouse gases, such as nitrous  
 
oxide or some fluorinated gases. The radiative forcing associated with non-CO2 emissions and changes in surface albedo is referred to as non-CO2 radiative forcing. {2.2.1}
13 There is a clear scientific basis for a total carbon budget consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. However, neither this total carbon budget nor the fraction of this budget  
 
taken up by past emissions were assessed in this Report.
14 Irrespective of the measure of global temperature used, updated understanding and further advances in methods have led to an increase in the estimated remaining carbon budget of  
 
about 300 GtCO2 compared to AR5. (medium confidence) {2.2.2}
15 These estimates use observed GMST to 2006–2015 and estimate future temperature changes using near surface air temperatures. 
C. 
Emission Pathways and System Transitions Consistent with 1.5°C 
Global Warming
C.1  
In model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions 
decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40–60% interquartile range), reaching net zero 
around 2050 (2045–2055 interquartile range). For limiting global warming to below 2°C11 CO2 
emissions are projected to decline by about 25% by 2030 in most pathways (10–30% interquartile 
range) and reach net zero around 2070 (2065–2080 interquartile range). Non-CO2 emissions in 
pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C show deep reductions that are similar to those in 
pathways limiting warming to 2°C. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.3a) {2.1, 2.3, Table 2.4} 
C.1.1 
CO2 emissions reductions that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot can involve different portfolios of 
mitigation measures, striking different balances between lowering energy and resource intensity, rate of decarbonization, 
and the reliance on carbon dioxide removal. Different portfolios face different implementation challenges and potential 
synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.3b) {2.3.2, 2.3.4, 2.4, 2.5.3}  
C.1.2 
Modelled pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot involve deep reductions in emissions 
of methane and black carbon (35% or more of both by 2050 relative to 2010). These pathways also reduce most of the 
cooling aerosols, which partially offsets mitigation effects for two to three decades. Non-CO2 emissions12 can be reduced 
as a result of broad mitigation measures in the energy sector. In addition, targeted non-CO2 mitigation measures can 
reduce nitrous oxide and methane from agriculture, methane from the waste sector, some sources of black carbon, and 
hydrofluorocarbons. High bioenergy demand can increase emissions of nitrous oxide in some 1.5°C pathways, highlighting 
the importance of appropriate management approaches. Improved air quality resulting from projected reductions in many 
non-CO2 emissions provide direct and immediate population health benefits in all 1.5°C model pathways. (high confidence) 
(Figure SPM.3a) {2.2.1, 2.3.3, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, 4.3.6, 5.4.2} 
C.1.3 
Limiting global warming requires limiting the total cumulative global anthropogenic emissions of CO2 since the pre-
industrial period, that is, staying within a total carbon budget (high confidence).13 By the end of 2017, anthropogenic CO2 
emissions since the pre-industrial period are estimated to have reduced the total carbon budget for 1.5°C by approximately 
2200 ± 320 GtCO2 (medium confidence). The associated remaining budget is being depleted by current emissions of 
42 ± 3 GtCO2 per year (high confidence). The choice of the measure of global temperature affects the estimated remaining 
carbon budget. Using global mean surface air temperature, as in AR5, gives an estimate of the remaining carbon budget of 
580 GtCO2 for a 50% probability of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and 420 GtCO2 for a 66% probability (medium confidence).14 
Alternatively, using GMST gives estimates of 770 and 570 GtCO2, for 50% and 66% probabilities,15 respectively (medium 
confidence). Uncertainties in the size of these estimated remaining carbon budgets are substantial and depend on several 
factors. Uncertainties in the climate response to CO2 and non-CO2 emissions contribute ±400 GtCO2 and the level of historic 
warming contributes ±250 GtCO2 (medium confidence). Potential additional carbon release from future permafrost thawing 
and methane release from wetlands would reduce budgets by up to 100 GtCO2 over the course of this century and more 
thereafter (medium confidence). In addition, the level of non-CO2 mitigation in the future could alter the remaining carbon 
budget by 250 GtCO2 in either direction (medium confidence). {1.2.4, 2.2.2, 2.6.1, Table 2.2, Chapter 2 Supplementary

Solar radiation modification (SRM) measures are not included in any of the available assessed pathways. Although some

Summary for Policymakers

Breakdown of contributions to global net CO2 emissions in four illustrative model pathways 
P1:  A scenario in which social, 
business and technological innovations 
result in lower energy demand up to 
2050 while living standards rise, 
especially in the global South. A 
downsized energy system enables 
rapid decarbonization of energy supply. 
Aﬀorestation is the only CDR option 
considered; neither fossil fuels with CCS 
nor BECCS are used.
P2:  A scenario with a broad focus on 
sustainability including energy 
intensity, human development, 
economic convergence and 
international cooperation, as well as 
shifs towards sustainable and healthy 
consumption patterns, low-carbon 
technology innovation, and 
well-managed land systems with 
limited societal acceptability for BECCS.
P3:  A middle-of-the-road scenario in
which societal as well as technological 
development follows historical 
patterns. Emissions reductions are 
mainly achieved by changing the way in 
which energy and products are 
produced, and to a lesser degree by 
reductions in demand.
P4:  A resource- and energy-intensive 
scenario in which economic growth and 
globalization lead to widespread 
adoption of greenhouse-gas-intensive 
lifestyles, including high demand for 
transportation fuels and livestock 
products. Emissions reductions are 
mainly achieved through technological 
means, making strong use of CDR 
through the deployment of BECCS.

Characteristics of four illustrative model pathways
Diﬀerent mitigation strategies can achieve the net emissions reductions that would be required to follow a 
pathway that limits global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. All pathways use Carbon Dioxide 
Removal (CDR), but the amount varies across pathways, as do the relative contributions of Bioenergy with 
Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and removals in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) 
sector. This has implications for emissions and several other pathway characteristics.

Figure SPM.3b | Characteristics of four illustrative model pathways in relation to global warming of 1.5°C introduced in Figure SPM.3a. These pathways were 
selected to show a range of potential mitigation approaches and vary widely in their projected energy and land use, as well as their assumptions about future 
socio-economic developments, including economic and population growth, equity and sustainability. A breakdown of the global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions 
into the contributions in terms of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel and industry; agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU); and bioenergy with carbon capture 
and storage (BECCS) is shown. AFOLU estimates reported here are not necessarily comparable with countries’ estimates. Further characteristics for each of these 
pathways are listed below each pathway. These pathways illustrate relative global differences in mitigation strategies, but do not represent central estimates, 
national strategies, and do not indicate requirements. For comparison, the right-most column shows the interquartile ranges across pathways with no or limited 
overshoot of 1.5°C. Pathways P1, P2, P3 and P4 correspond to the LED, S1, S2 and S5 pathways assessed in Chapter 2 (Figure SPM.3a). {2.2.1, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 
2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, Figure 2.5, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.10, Figure 2.11, Figure 2.14, Figure 2.15, Figure 2.16, Figure 2.17, Figure 2.24,

C.2  
Pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot would require rapid 
and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and 
buildings), and industrial systems (high confidence). These systems transitions are unprecedented 
in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed, and imply deep emissions reductions in all 
sectors, a wide portfolio of mitigation options and a significant upscaling of investments in those 
options (medium confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5}
C.2.1 
Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot show system changes that are more rapid and 
pronounced over the next two decades than in 2°C pathways (high confidence). The rates of system changes associated 
with limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot have occurred in the past within specific sectors, 
technologies and spatial contexts, but there is no documented historic precedent for their scale (medium confidence). 
{2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4, 2.5, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4} 
C.2.2 
In energy systems, modelled global pathways (considered in the literature) limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot (for more details see Figure SPM.3b) generally meet energy service demand with lower energy use, 
including through enhanced energy efficiency, and show faster electrification of energy end use compared to 2°C (high 
confidence). In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, low-emission energy sources are projected to have a higher 
share, compared with 2°C pathways, particularly before 2050 (high confidence). In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited 
overshoot, renewables are projected to supply 70–85% (interquartile range) of electricity in 2050 (high confidence). In 
electricity generation, shares of nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) are modelled to 
increase in most 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot. In modelled 1.5°C pathways with limited or no overshoot, 
the use of CCS would allow the electricity generation share of gas to be approximately 8% (3–11% interquartile range) 
of global electricity in 2050, while the use of coal shows a steep reduction in all pathways and would be reduced to close 
to 0% (0–2% interquartile range) of electricity (high confidence). While acknowledging the challenges, and differences 
between the options and national circumstances, political, economic, social and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind 
energy and electricity storage technologies have substantially improved over the past few years (high confidence). These 
improvements signal a potential system transition in electricity generation. (Figure SPM.3b) {2.4.1, 2.4.2, Figure 2.1, Table

CO2 emissions from industry in pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot are projected to 
be about 65–90% (interquartile range) lower in 2050 relative to 2010, as compared to 50–80% for global warming of 
2°C (medium confidence). Such reductions can be achieved through combinations of new and existing technologies and 
practices, including electrification, hydrogen, sustainable bio-based feedstocks, product substitution, and carbon capture, 
utilization and storage (CCUS). These options are technically proven at various scales but their large-scale deployment 
may be limited by economic, financial, human capacity and institutional constraints in specific contexts, and specific 
characteristics of large-scale industrial installations. In industry, emissions reductions by energy and process efficiency 
by themselves are insufficient for limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). {2.4.3, 4.2.1,

The urban and infrastructure system transition consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot

and practices enabling deep emissions reductions include various energy efficiency options. In pathways limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the electricity share of energy demand in buildings would be about 55–75% 
in 2050 compared to 50–70% in 2050 for 2°C global warming (medium confidence). In the transport sector, the share of 
low-emission final energy would rise from less than 5% in 2020 to about 35–65% in 2050 compared to 25–45% for 2°C 
of global warming (medium confidence). Economic, institutional and socio-cultural barriers may inhibit these urban and 
infrastructure system transitions, depending on national, regional and local circumstances, capabilities and the availability 
of capital (high confidence). {2.3.4, 2.4.3, 4.2.1, Table 4.1, 4.3.3, 4.5.2}
C.2.5 
Transitions in global and regional land use are found in all pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot, but their scale depends on the pursued mitigation portfolio. Model pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C 
with no or limited overshoot project a 4 million km2 reduction to a 2.5 million km2 increase of non-pasture agricultural land 
for food and feed crops and a 0.5–11 million km2 reduction of pasture land, to be converted into a 0–6 million km2 increase 
of agricultural land for energy crops and a 2 million km2 reduction to 9.5 million km2 increase in forests by 2050 relative 
to 2010 (medium confidence).16 Land-use transitions of similar magnitude can be observed in modelled 2°C pathways 
(medium confidence). Such large transitions pose profound challenges for sustainable management of the various demands 
on land for human settlements, food, livestock feed, fibre, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity and other ecosystem 
services (high confidence). Mitigation options limiting the demand for land include sustainable intensification of land-use 
practices, ecosystem restoration and changes towards less resource-intensive diets (high confidence). The implementation 
of land-based mitigation options would require overcoming socio-economic, institutional, technological, financing and 
environmental barriers that differ across regions (high confidence). {2.4.4, Figure 2.24, 4.3.2, 4.3.7, 4.5.2, Cross-Chapter 
Box 7 in Chapter 3}
C.2.6 
Additional annual average energy-related investments for the period 2016 to 2050 in pathways limiting warming to 
1.5°C compared to pathways without new climate policies beyond those in place today are estimated to be around 830 
billion USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion USD2010 across six models17). This compares to total annual average 
energy supply investments in 1.5°C pathways of 1460 to 3510 billion USD2010 and total annual average energy demand 
investments of 640 to 910 billion USD2010 for the period 2016 to 2050. Total energy-related investments increase by 
about 12% (range of 3% to 24%) in 1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. Annual investments in low-carbon energy 
technologies and energy efficiency are upscaled by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of 4 to 10) by 2050 compared to 
2015 (medium confidence). {2.5.2, Box 4.8, Figure 2.27}
C.2.7 
Modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot project a wide range of global average 
discounted marginal abatement costs over the 21st century. They are roughly 3-4 times higher than in pathways limiting 
global warming to below 2°C (high confidence). The economic literature distinguishes marginal abatement costs from total 
mitigation costs in the economy. The literature on total mitigation costs of 1.5°C mitigation pathways is limited and was 
not assessed in this Report. Knowledge gaps remain in the integrated assessment of the economy-wide costs and benefits 
of mitigation in line with pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. {2.5.2; 2.6; Figure 2.26}

C.3  
All pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot project the use of 
carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on the order of 100–1000 GtCO2 over the 21st century. CDR would 
be used to compensate for residual emissions and, in most cases, achieve net negative emissions 
to return global warming to 1.5°C following a peak (high confidence). CDR deployment of several 
hundreds of GtCO2 is subject to multiple feasibility and sustainability constraints (high confidence). 
Significant near-term emissions reductions and measures to lower energy and land demand can 
limit CDR deployment to a few hundred GtCO2 without reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture 
and storage (BECCS) (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 3.6.2, 4.3, 5.4}  
C.3.1 
Existing and potential CDR measures include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, 
BECCS, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization. These differ widely 
in terms of maturity, potentials, costs, risks, co-benefits and trade-offs (high confidence). To date, only a few published 
pathways include CDR measures other than afforestation and BECCS. {2.3.4, 3.6.2, 4.3.2, 4.3.7}
C.3.2 
In pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot, BECCS deployment is projected to range from 
0–1, 0–8, and 0–16 GtCO2 yr−1 in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively, while agriculture, forestry and land-use (AFOLU) 
related CDR measures are projected to remove 0–5, 1–11, and 1–5 GtCO2 yr−1 in these years (medium confidence). The 
upper end of these deployment ranges by mid-century exceeds the BECCS potential of up to 5 GtCO2 yr−1 and afforestation 
potential of up to 3.6 GtCO2 yr−1 assessed based on recent literature (medium confidence). Some pathways avoid BECCS 
deployment completely through demand-side measures and greater reliance on AFOLU-related CDR measures (medium 
confidence). The use of bioenergy can be as high or even higher when BECCS is excluded compared to when it is included 
due to its potential for replacing fossil fuels across sectors (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b) {2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4.2, 3.6.2, 
4.3.1, 4.2.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.7, 4.4.3, Table 2.4}
C.3.3 
Pathways that overshoot 1.5°C of global warming rely on CDR exceeding residual CO2 emissions later in the century to 
return to below 1.5°C by 2100, with larger overshoots requiring greater amounts of CDR (Figure SPM.3b) (high confidence). 
Limitations on the speed, scale, and societal acceptability of CDR deployment hence determine the ability to return global 
warming to below 1.5°C following an overshoot. Carbon cycle and climate system understanding is still limited about the 
effectiveness of net negative emissions to reduce temperatures after they peak (high confidence). {2.2, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.6, 
4.3.7, 4.5.2, Table 4.11}
C.3.4 
Most current and potential CDR measures could have significant impacts on land, energy, water or nutrients if deployed 
at large scale (high confidence). Afforestation and bioenergy may compete with other land uses and may have significant 
impacts on agricultural and food systems, biodiversity, and other ecosystem functions and services (high confidence). 
Effective governance is needed to limit such trade-offs and ensure permanence of carbon removal in terrestrial, geological 
and ocean reservoirs (high confidence). Feasibility and sustainability of CDR use could be enhanced by a portfolio of options 
deployed at substantial, but lesser scales, rather than a single option at very large scale (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b) 
{2.3.4, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, 2.6, 3.6.2, 4.3.2, 4.3.7, 4.5.2, 5.4.1, 5.4.2; Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in Chapter 3, Table 4.11, Table 
5.3, Figure 5.3}
C.3.5 
Some AFOLU-related CDR measures such as restoration of natural ecosystems and soil carbon sequestration could provide 
co-benefits such as improved biodiversity, soil quality, and local food security. If deployed at large scale, they would 
require governance systems enabling sustainable land management to conserve and protect land carbon stocks and other 
ecosystem functions and services (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 3.6.2, 5.4.1, Cross-Chapter

Strengthening the Global Response in the Context of Sustainable 
Development and Efforts to Eradicate Poverty
D.1 
Estimates of the global emissions outcome of current nationally stated mitigation ambitions as 
submitted under the Paris Agreement would lead to global greenhouse gas emissions18 in 2030 
of 52–58 GtCO2eq yr−1 (medium confidence). Pathways reflecting these ambitions would not limit 
global warming to 1.5°C, even if supplemented by very challenging increases in the scale and 
ambition of emissions reductions after 2030 (high confidence). Avoiding overshoot and reliance 
on future large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) can only be achieved if global 
CO2 emissions start to decline well before 2030 (high confidence). {1.2, 2.3, 3.3, 3.4, 4.2, 4.4, Cross-
Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4} 
D.1.1 
Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot show clear emission reductions by 2030 (high 
confidence). All but one show a decline in global greenhouse gas emissions to below 35 GtCO2eq yr−1 in 2030, and half of 
available pathways fall within the 25–30 GtCO2eq yr−1 range (interquartile range), a 40–50% reduction from 2010 levels 
(high confidence). Pathways reflecting current nationally stated mitigation ambition until 2030 are broadly consistent 
with cost-effective pathways that result in a global warming of about 3°C by 2100, with warming continuing afterwards 
(medium confidence). {2.3.3, 2.3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4, 5.5.3.2}
D.1.2 
Overshoot trajectories result in higher impacts and associated challenges compared to pathways that limit global warming 
to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). Reversing warming after an overshoot of 0.2°C or larger during 
this century would require upscaling and deployment of CDR at rates and volumes that might not be achievable given 
considerable implementation challenges (medium confidence). {1.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.5.1, 3.3, 4.3.7, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in 
Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}
D.1.3 
The lower the emissions in 2030, the lower the challenge in limiting global warming to 1.5°C after 2030 with no or limited 
overshoot (high confidence). The challenges from delayed actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include the risk of 
cost escalation, lock-in in carbon-emitting infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced flexibility in future response options 
in the medium to long term (high confidence). These may increase uneven distributional impacts between countries at 
different stages of development (medium confidence). {2.3.5, 4.4.5, 5.4.2}
D.2 
The avoided climate change impacts on sustainable development, eradication of poverty and reducing 
inequalities would be greater if global warming were limited to 1.5°C rather than 2°C, if mitigation 
and adaptation synergies are maximized while trade-offs are minimized (high confidence). {1.1, 1.4, 
2.5, 3.3, 3.4, 5.2, Table 5.1}
D.2.1 
Climate change impacts and responses are closely linked to sustainable development which balances social well-being, 
economic prosperity and environmental protection. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 
2015, provide an established framework for assessing the links between global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C and development 
goals that include poverty eradication, reducing inequalities, and climate action. (high confidence) {Cross-Chapter Box 4 in 
Chapter 1, 1.4, 5.1}
D.2.2 
The consideration of ethics and equity can help address the uneven distribution of adverse impacts associated with 
1.5°C and higher levels of global warming, as well as those from mitigation and adaptation, particularly for poor and 
disadvantaged populations, in all societies (high confidence). {1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.4.3, 2.5.3, 3.4.10, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3. 5.4, Cross-

dimensions of feasibility. Strengthened multilevel governance, institutional capacity, policy instruments, technological 
innovation and transfer and mobilization of finance, and changes in human behaviour and lifestyles are enabling conditions 
that enhance the feasibility of mitigation and adaptation options for 1.5°C-consistent systems transitions. (high confidence)

D.3 
Adaptation options specific to national contexts, if carefully selected together with enabling 
conditions, will have benefits for sustainable development and poverty reduction with global 
warming of 1.5°C, although trade-offs are possible (high confidence). {1.4, 4.3, 4.5}
D.3.1 
Adaptation options that reduce the vulnerability of human and natural systems have many synergies with sustainable 
development, if well managed, such as ensuring food and water security, reducing disaster risks, improving health 
conditions, maintaining ecosystem services and reducing poverty and inequality (high confidence). Increasing investment 
in physical and social infrastructure is a key enabling condition to enhance the resilience and the adaptive capacities 
of societies. These benefits can occur in most regions with adaptation to 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). 
{1.4.3, 4.2.2, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.5, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, 4.5.3, 5.3.1, 5.3.2}
D.3.2 
Adaptation to 1.5°C global warming can also result in trade-offs or maladaptations with adverse impacts for sustainable 
development. For example, if poorly designed or implemented, adaptation projects in a range of sectors can increase 
greenhouse gas emissions and water use, increase gender and social inequality, undermine health conditions, and encroach 
on natural ecosystems (high confidence). These trade-offs can be reduced by adaptations that include attention to poverty 
and sustainable development (high confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.5.4, 5.3.2; Cross-Chapter Boxes 6 and 7 in Chapter 3} 
D.3.3 
A mix of adaptation and mitigation options to limit global warming to 1.5°C, implemented in a participatory and integrated 
manner, can enable rapid, systemic transitions in urban and rural areas (high confidence). These are most effective when 
aligned with economic and sustainable development, and when local and regional governments and decision makers are 
supported by national governments (medium confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.2}
D.3.4 
Adaptation options that also mitigate emissions can provide synergies and cost savings in most sectors and system 
transitions, such as when land management reduces emissions and disaster risk, or when low-carbon buildings are also 
designed for efficient cooling. Trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation, when limiting global warming to 1.5°C, 
such as when bioenergy crops, reforestation or afforestation encroach on land needed for agricultural adaptation, can 
undermine food security, livelihoods, ecosystem functions and services and other aspects of sustainable development. (high 
confidence) {3.4.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4}
D.4 
Mitigation options consistent with 1.5°C pathways are associated with multiple synergies and trade-
offs across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While the total number of possible synergies 
exceeds the number of trade-offs, their net effect will depend on the pace and magnitude of changes, 
the composition of the mitigation portfolio and the management of the transition. (high confidence) 
(Figure SPM.4) {2.5, 4.5, 5.4} 
D.4.1 
1.5°C pathways have robust synergies particularly for the SDGs 3 (health), 7 (clean energy), 11 (cities and communities), 12 
(responsible consumption and production) and 14 (oceans) (very high confidence). Some 1.5°C pathways show potential 
trade-offs with mitigation for SDGs 1 (poverty), 2 (hunger), 6 (water) and 7 (energy access), if not managed carefully (high 
confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {5.4.2; Figure 5.4, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in Chapter 3}  
D.4.2 
1.5°C pathways that include low energy demand (e.g., see P1 in Figure SPM.3a and SPM.3b), low material consumption, 
and low GHG-intensive food consumption have the most pronounced synergies and the lowest number of trade-offs with 
respect to sustainable development and the SDGs (high confidence). Such pathways would reduce dependence on CDR. In 
modelled pathways, sustainable development, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality can support limiting warming to 
1.5°C (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b, Figure SPM.4) {2.4.3, 2.5.1, 2.5.3, Figure 2.4, Figure 2.28, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, Figure 5.4}

Indicative linkages between mitigation options and sustainable 
development using SDGs (The linkages do not show costs and benefits)
Mitigation options deployed in each sector can be associated with potential positive eﬀects (synergies) or 
negative eﬀects (trade-oﬀs) with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The degree to which this 
potential is realized will depend on the selected portfolio of mitigation options, mitigation policy design, 
and local circumstances and context. Particularly in the energy-demand sector, the potential for synergies is 
larger than for trade-oﬀs. The bars group individually assessed options by level of confidence and take into

1.5°C and 2°C modelled pathways often rely on the deployment of large-scale land-related measures like afforestation 
and bioenergy supply, which, if poorly managed, can compete with food production and hence raise food security concerns 
(high confidence). The impacts of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options on SDGs depend on the type of options and the 
scale of deployment (high confidence). If poorly implemented, CDR options such as BECCS and AFOLU options would lead 
to trade-offs. Context-relevant design and implementation requires considering people’s needs, biodiversity, and other 
sustainable development dimensions (very high confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {5.4.1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3} 
D.4.4 
Mitigation consistent with 1.5°C pathways creates risks for sustainable development in regions with high dependency on 
fossil fuels for revenue and employment generation (high confidence). Policies that promote diversification of the economy 
and the energy sector can address the associated challenges (high confidence). {5.4.1.2, Box 5.2} 
D.4.5 
Redistributive policies across sectors and populations that shield the poor and vulnerable can resolve trade-offs for a range 
of SDGs, particularly hunger, poverty and energy access. Investment needs for such complementary policies are only a small 
fraction of the overall mitigation investments in 1.5°C pathways. (high confidence) {2.4.3, 5.4.2, Figure 5.5} 
D.5 
Limiting the risks from global warming of 1.5°C in the context of sustainable development and 
poverty eradication implies system transitions that can be enabled by an increase of adaptation 
and mitigation investments, policy instruments, the acceleration of technological innovation and 
behaviour changes (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.2, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6}
D.5.1 
Directing finance towards investment in infrastructure for mitigation and adaptation could provide additional resources.  
This could involve the mobilization of private funds by institutional investors, asset managers and development or 
investment banks, as well as the provision of public funds. Government policies that lower the risk of low-emission and 
adaptation investments can facilitate the mobilization of private funds and enhance the effectiveness of other public 
policies. Studies indicate a number of challenges, including access to finance and mobilization of funds. (high confidence) 
{2.5.1, 2.5.2, 4.4.5} 
D.5.2 
Adaptation finance consistent with global warming of 1.5°C is difficult to quantify and compare with 2°C. Knowledge 
gaps include insufficient data to calculate specific climate resilience-enhancing investments from the provision of currently 
underinvested basic infrastructure. Estimates of the costs of adaptation might be lower at global warming of 1.5°C than for 
2°C. Adaptation needs have typically been supported by public sector sources such as national and subnational government 
budgets, and in developing countries together with support from development assistance, multilateral development banks, 
and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change channels (medium confidence). More recently there is a

Potential synergies and trade-offs between the sectoral portfolio of climate change mitigation options and the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). The SDGs serve as an analytical framework for the assessment of the different sustainable development dimensions, which extend beyond the time frame 
of the 2030 SDG targets. The assessment is based on literature on mitigation options that are considered relevant for 1.5°C. The assessed strength of the SDG 
interactions is based on the qualitative and quantitative assessment of individual mitigation options listed in Table 5.2. For each mitigation option, the strength of 
the SDG-connection as well as the associated confidence of the underlying literature (shades of green and red) was assessed. The strength of positive connections 
(synergies) and negative connections (trade-offs) across all individual options within a sector (see Table 5.2) are aggregated into sectoral potentials for the whole 
mitigation portfolio. The (white) areas outside the bars, which indicate no interactions, have low confidence due to the uncertainty and limited number of studies 
exploring indirect effects. The strength of the connection considers only the effect of mitigation and does not include benefits of avoided impacts. SDG 13 (climate 
action) is not listed because mitigation is being considered in terms of interactions with SDGs and not vice versa. The bars denote the strength of the connection, 
and do not consider the strength of the impact on the SDGs. The energy demand sector comprises behavioural responses, fuel switching and efficiency options in 
the transport, industry and building sector as well as carbon capture options in the industry sector. Options assessed in the energy supply sector comprise biomass 
and non-biomass renewables, nuclear, carbon capture and storage (CCS) with bioenergy, and CCS with fossil fuels. Options in the land sector comprise agricultural 
and forest options, sustainable diets and reduced food waste, soil sequestration, livestock and manure management, reduced deforestation, afforestation and 
reforestation, and responsible sourcing. In addition to this figure, options in the ocean sector are discussed in the underlying report. {5.4, Table 5.2, Figure 5.2}
Information about the net impacts of mitigation on sustainable development in 1.5°C pathways is available only for a limited number of SDGs and mitigation 
options. Only a limited number of studies have assessed the benefits of avoided climate change impacts of 1.5°C pathways for the SDGs, and the co-effects 
of adaptation for mitigation and the SDGs. The assessment of the indicative mitigation potentials in Figure SPM.4 is a step further from AR5 towards a more 
comprehensive and integrated assessment in the future.

through market and non-market based instruments as well as accompanying measures to secure the equity of the 
transition, acknowledging the challenges related with implementation, including those of energy costs, depreciation of 
assets and impacts on international competition, and utilizing the opportunities to maximize co-benefits (high confidence). 
{1.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4, 4.4.5, 5.5.2}
D.5.5 
The systems transitions consistent with adapting to and limiting global warming to 1.5°C include the widespread adoption 
of new and possibly disruptive technologies and practices and enhanced climate-driven innovation. These imply enhanced 
technological innovation capabilities, including in industry and finance. Both national innovation policies and international 
cooperation can contribute to the development, commercialization and widespread adoption of mitigation and adaptation 
technologies. Innovation policies may be more effective when they combine public support for research and development 
with policy mixes that provide incentives for technology diffusion. (high confidence) {4.4.4, 4.4.5}.  
D.5.6 
Education, information, and community approaches, including those that are informed by indigenous knowledge and local 
knowledge, can accelerate the wide-scale behaviour changes consistent with adapting to and limiting global warming to 
1.5°C. These approaches are more effective when combined with other policies and tailored to the motivations, capabilities 
and resources of specific actors and contexts (high confidence). Public acceptability can enable or inhibit the implementation 
of policies and measures to limit global warming to 1.5°C and to adapt to the consequences. Public acceptability depends 
on the individual’s evaluation of expected policy consequences, the perceived fairness of the distribution of these 
consequences, and perceived fairness of decision procedures (high confidence). {1.1, 1.5, 4.3.5, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, Box 4.3, 5.5.3, 
5.6.5} 
D.6 
Sustainable development supports, and often enables, the fundamental societal and systems 
transitions and transformations that help limit global warming to 1.5°C. Such changes facilitate the 
pursuit of climate-resilient development pathways that achieve ambitious mitigation and adaptation 
in conjunction with poverty eradication and efforts to reduce inequalities (high confidence). {Box 1.1, 
1.4.3, Figure 5.1, 5.5.3, Box 5.3} 
D.6.1 
Social justice and equity are core aspects of climate-resilient development pathways that aim to limit global warming to 
1.5°C as they address challenges and inevitable trade-offs, widen opportunities, and ensure that options, visions, and values 
are deliberated, between and within countries and communities, without making the poor and disadvantaged worse off 
(high confidence). {5.5.2, 5.5.3, Box 5.3, Figure 5.1, Figure 5.6, Cross-Chapter Boxes 12 and 13 in Chapter 5}
D.6.2 
The potential for climate-resilient development pathways differs between and within regions and nations, due to different 
development contexts and systemic vulnerabilities (very high confidence). Efforts along such pathways to date have been 
limited (medium confidence) and enhanced efforts would involve strengthened and timely action from all countries and 
non-state actors (high confidence). {5.5.1, 5.5.3, Figure 5.1}
D.6.3 
Pathways that are consistent with sustainable development show fewer mitigation and adaptation challenges and are 
associated with lower mitigation costs. The large majority of modelling studies could not construct pathways characterized 
by lack of international cooperation, inequality and poverty that were able to limit global warming to 1.5°C. (high 
confidence) {2.3.1, 2.5.1, 2.5.3, 5.5.2}

D.7 
Strengthening the capacities for climate action of national and sub-national authorities, civil society, 
the private sector, indigenous peoples and local communities can support the implementation of 
ambitious actions implied by limiting global warming to 1.5°C (high confidence). International 
cooperation can provide an enabling environment for this to be achieved in all countries and for all 
people, in the context of sustainable development. International cooperation is a critical enabler for 
developing countries and vulnerable regions (high confidence). {1.4, 2.3, 2.5, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5,

Chapter 5}
D.7.1 
Partnerships involving non-state public and private actors, institutional investors, the banking system, civil society and 
scientific institutions would facilitate actions and responses consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C (very high 
confidence). {1.4, 4.4.1, 4.2.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.5, 4.5.3, 5.4.1, 5.6.2, Box 5.3}.
D.7.2 
Cooperation on strengthened accountable multilevel governance that includes non-state actors such as industry, civil 
society and scientific institutions, coordinated sectoral and cross-sectoral policies at various governance levels, gender-
sensitive policies, finance including innovative financing, and cooperation on technology development and transfer can 
ensure participation, transparency, capacity building and learning among different players (high confidence). {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 
4.2.2, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, 4.5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, 5.3.1, 5.5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 13 in Chapter 
5, 5.6.1, 5.6.3}
D.7.3 
International cooperation is a critical enabler for developing countries and vulnerable regions to strengthen their action for 
the implementation of 1.5°C-consistent climate responses, including through enhancing access to finance and technology 
and enhancing domestic capacities, taking into account national and local circumstances and needs (high confidence). 
{2.3.1, 2.5.1, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, 5.4.1 5.5.3, 5.6.1, Box 4.1, Box 4.2, Box 4.7}.
D.7.4 
Collective efforts at all levels, in ways that reflect different circumstances and capabilities, in the pursuit of limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C, taking into account equity as well as effectiveness, can facilitate strengthening the global response to 
climate change, achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty (high confidence). {1.4.2, 2.3.1, 2.5.1, 2.5.2,

Box SPM.1: Core Concepts Central to this Special Report 
Global mean surface temperature (GMST): Estimated global average of near-surface air temperatures over land and 
sea ice, and sea surface temperatures over ice-free ocean regions, with changes normally expressed as departures from a 
value over a specified reference period. When estimating changes in GMST, near-surface air temperature over both land 
and oceans are also used.19 {1.2.1.1} 
Pre-industrial: The multi-century period prior to the onset of large-scale industrial activity around 1750. The reference 
period 1850–1900 is used to approximate pre-industrial GMST. {1.2.1.2} 
Global warming: The estimated increase in GMST averaged over a 30-year period, or the 30-year period centred on a 
particular year or decade, expressed relative to pre-industrial levels unless otherwise specified. For 30-year periods that 
span past and future years, the current multi-decadal warming trend is assumed to continue. {1.2.1}
Net zero CO2 emissions: Net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are achieved when anthropogenic CO2 emissions are 
balanced globally by anthropogenic CO2 removals over a specified period. 
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR): Anthropogenic activities removing CO2 from the atmosphere and durably storing it in 
geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products. It includes existing and potential anthropogenic enhancement of 
biological or geochemical sinks and direct air capture and storage, but excludes natural CO2 uptake not directly caused by 
human activities.
Total carbon budget: Estimated cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions from the pre-industrial period 
to the time that anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach net zero that would result, at some probability, in limiting global 
warming to a given level, accounting for the impact of other anthropogenic emissions. {2.2.2} 
Remaining carbon budget: Estimated cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions from a given start date to the 
time that anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach net zero that would result, at some probability, in limiting global warming 
to a given level, accounting for the impact of other anthropogenic emissions. {2.2.2}
Temperature overshoot: The temporary exceedance of a specified level of global warming. 
Emission pathways: In this Summary for Policymakers, the modelled trajectories of global anthropogenic emissions over 
the 21st century are termed emission pathways. Emission pathways are classified by their temperature trajectory over 
the 21st century: pathways giving at least 50% probability based on current knowledge of limiting global warming to 
below 1.5°C are classified as ‘no overshoot’; those limiting warming to below 1.6°C and returning to 1.5°C by 2100 are 
classified as ‘1.5°C limited-overshoot’; while those exceeding 1.6°C but still returning to 1.5°C by 2100 are classified as 
‘higher-overshoot’.
Impacts: Effects of climate change on human and natural systems. Impacts can have beneficial or adverse outcomes 
for livelihoods, health and well-being, ecosystems and species, services, infrastructure, and economic, social and cultural 
assets.
Risk: The potential for adverse consequences from a climate-related hazard for human and natural systems, resulting 
from the interactions between the hazard and the vulnerability and exposure of the affected system. Risk integrates 
the likelihood of exposure to a hazard and the magnitude of its impact. Risk also can describe the potential for adverse 
consequences of adaptation or mitigation responses to climate change. 
Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs): Trajectories that strengthen sustainable development at multiple 
scales and efforts to eradicate poverty through equitable societal and systems transitions and transformations while 
reducing the threat of climate change through ambitious mitigation, adaptation and climate resilience. 
19 Past IPCC reports, reflecting the literature, have used a variety of approximately equivalent metrics of GMST change.
