forests trusting in trees  how four countries transformed their forests 14 november 2018 sustainable bioenergy from arcticcircle snowladen pines to damp equatorial rainforests to dry australian scrublands the planet is home to an incredibly diverse range of forested environments and while each region is very different almost all have been impacted by humans the effects of this have not always been positive and despite decades spent raising awareness of the importance of forests for the health of the world some regions forests remain in decline africa and asia in particular have seen a decline in forest cover although each year sees less lost over the past few decades but there are areas where the impact of humans is in fact having a positive effect this is largely thanks to the introduction of modern sustainable forestry practices  which have incentivised growth and helped bringing a variety of environmental and economic benefits to different regions around the world a recent report by pöyry management consulting for drax has looked in depth at these benefits and in particular four regions where different approaches to sustainable forestry have brought a positive impact to people industry and the environment alike more than a testament to the beneficial effects sustainable forest management can have it shows that while the tactics methods and environments may differ their positive effects are universal us south turning around old practices weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama the forests of the us south from virginia and kentucky to texas and florida have a long history of misuse both indigenous people and later european settlers used disruptive techniques such as large scale burning and removed valuable mature hardwood on a mass scale often leaving areas to naturally regenerate that largely changed in the mid20 th century however when forestry became moreintensive and the need for sustaining a supply of quality timber grew more apparent the introduction of processes such as thinning and managed regeneration helped usher in a more responsible approach that has led to growth in both the forestry industry and forest coverage between 2010 and 2015 there was 50 more growth in the volume of forests than was removed from harvesting more than just growing forest area this means an increase in the amount of carbon being absorbed and stored from the atmosphere charts us south historical increment to removal and us south above ground carbon 19571997  in the us south around 86 of forest land is privately owned by either corporations or individuals but the economics of sustainable forestry practices has encouraged the overall growth in forests even with limited regulations on land use in the area in addition to the native birds and mammals that depend on sustainably managed forests in the region more than 200000 people were employed by the industry in 2016 making it a vital part of local rural economies finland a centurylong history of sustainable practices asikkala finland by taneli lahtinen on unsplash wood and wood products play an important role in finnish culture from its famous saunas to the worlds largest wooden church  multinational phone brand nokia even started life in in 1865 as a wood pulp mill a high demand for wood as a commercial product meant that a few centuries ago finlands forests where in a state of heavy degradation but starting as far back as 100 years ago sustainable practices such as planned harvesting and regeneration legislation were introduced the results are significant there is now more wood in finnish forests today than at the turn of the century the majority 61 of finlands forests are privately owned with the state owning 25 companies only owning 8 and 5 held by other owners many large companies however offer services such as forestry work wood sales drainage and tax services to private owners this collaboration between sectors allows for best practices to be easily shared and quickly become widespread as a result forest stocks have increased from 1500 million m 3 in 1970 to 2500 million m 3 in 2015 even while overall forest area has remained largely the same it highlights the effectiveness of legislation guidelines and certification in regenerating forests chart forest growing stock in finland  uk incentivising growth and diversity the uk was once thought to be 30 covered by forestland but by the turn of the last century forests made up less than 5 today however this has grown to as much as 13 owing largely to regulation and incentives chart forest area in uk by country and type over previous 10 years   as far back as the 1700s the uk had become dependent on wood imports from new england in the us and the baltics in europe following the first world war the forestry commission was established primarily to try prevent timber shortages during times of war but it went on to drive a boom in new plantations across the country and introduce grant schemes for private plantations chart top 10 net importers of wood products  in 2017 the uk was the worlds second largest net importer of wood products a problem with this afforestation however was that it mostly consisted of monocultures of exotic species that were well suited to the climate rather than regenerating native species the modern uk forestry standard is countering this practice by putting in place requirements for afforestation and replanting that protect biodiversity landscape and climate change as well as soil and water forest in argyll and bute some 73 of the uks forests are privately owned which includes historic estates and charitable trusts as well as investment funds despite the increasing forest area in the uk over the past century imports of both wood and wood products still make up almost 80 of the uks wood needs the upside for the region is increased recreational and preserved historic forests uruguay sustainably managing rapid expansion uruguays forestry industry is much younger than the likes of the us south or finland but offers an example of a how to rapidly expand the sector while preserving its old growth or primary forests eucalyptus trees in uruguayan working forest in 1975 the country introduced incentives such as tax waivers on forest operations and later subsidies for new plantations as well as tax duties for timber exports the result was a surge in eucalyptus plantations which grew from 25000 hectares in 1987 to more than 1 million hectares in 2015 largely driven by interest from international companies and investors these plantations are currently managed sustainably with growth still exceeding removals eucalyptus is not a native species to uruguay but by allowing international investors to plant on land deemed of no agricultural or environmental value the country has seen enormous afforestation while 800000 hectares of native forests remain the economic impact is similarly impressive today forestry directly employees 15000 people in uruguay  55 in forestry and logging and 45 in wood processing the skills required to work in newly constructed mills has led to several courses in forestry and wood science

assessment of the benefits of sustainable forest management pdf tags forestry and forest management and arboriculture  forests the everyday and future ways you use forest products 24 august 2018 sustainable bioenergy think of the products that come from forests and you might think of the centuries of shipbuilding construction and cooking made possible by civilisations utilising this plentiful natural resource what you might not think of is the complex construction of chemicals and matter that make up the trees of a forest  nor of the countless ways these can be broken down and used yet this is the reality of forests from essential oils to sturdy packaging to powerful adhesives trees are used to create a range of products that make daily life possible and as awareness of the need to reduce plastic consumption grows research into forest products and how they can replace the lessenvironmentally friendly objects is growing here we look at five of the most common products used today and maybe in the future that owe something to forests adhesives from tall oil anyone who has encountered tree sap can attest trees are made up of some pretty sticky stuff and its because of this that they have long been a source for adhesives production  from glue to cement the substance that makes this possible is known as tall oil named after the swedish word tallolja  meaning pine oil it is a byproduct of pulping coniferous trees tall oil has been produced commercially since the 1930s when the invention of the recovery boiler made it possible to extract it from the kraft pulping process  however the resins and waxes tall oil is made up of have a longer history these are also known as naval products due to their historic use in ship building and can be tapped directly from living trees today tall oil is also used in asphalt roofing as well as medical and cosmetic applications one of tall oils most exciting uses is as bioverno  a renewable alternative to diesel made in the worlds first commercialscale biorefinery in finland disinfectants and detergents from turpentine tapping trees has historically been a means of extracting multiple useful substances and one of the most versatile of these is turpentine this yellowish liquid is produced from distilled tree resin and has a long history of uses turpentine has been used since roman times as torch or lamp fuel but its antiseptic properties also means it was often used as medicine while doctors today would advise against drinking turpentine as was prescribed in the past it is still used today in disinfectants detergents and cleaning products giving off a fresh pinelike odour fuels to replace fossils biomass pellets from working forests are just one of the ways trees are providing renewable energy one other form is cellulosic ethanol a new second generation of liquid biofuel rather than competing with food supply often a concern in the creation of biodiesels cellulosic ethanol is made from nonfood based materials such as forest and agricultural residues left behind after harvest  wheat straw  and timber processing wastes including sawdust it is now being produced at a commercial scale in europe the us and brazil  woody biomass can also be converted into a petroleum substitute known as pyrolysis oil or biooil biomass is transformed into this dark brown liquid by heating it to 500 o c in an oxygendeprived environment and then allowing it to cool biooil has a much higher energy density than biomass in chip or pellet form and after upgrading can be used as jet fuel or as a petroleum alternative in chemical manufacturing  vanilla ice cream and carbon fibre from lignin lignin is what gives trees their tough woody quality  and after cellulose is the worlds second most abundant natural polymer polymers are very long molecules made up of many smaller molecules joined endtoend most often associated with plastic which is a synthetic polymer lignin is generally a waste product from the paper pulping process and is often burnt as fuel however it can also serve as a vanilla flavouring  a property that may make lignin an important resource in the face of an impending vanilla pod shortage  futurelooking research however aims to unlock much more from the 50 million tonnes of lignin produced every year globally  one of the most promising of these is as an alternative source of a family of organic compound known as phenylpropanoids  these are normally extracted from petroleum and are hugely useful in producing plastics and carbon fibre as well as drugs and paint nanocellulose and the future of forest products cellulose is already one of the most important products to come from forests thanks to its role in paper production however this abundant substance  which is also the primary material in the cell walls of all green plants  holds even more potential by shrinking cellulose down to a nano level it can be configured to be very strong while remaining very light  this opens it up as a product with many possibilities including using it as a source of bioplastics  some bioplastics  polylactic acid pha pbs and starch blends  are biodegradable alternatives to fossil fuelbased plastics and could potentially help solve some of the worlds mostpressing waste issues not all biobased plastics are biodegradable however the property of biodegradation doesnt depend on the resource basis of a material  it is linked to its chemical structure in other words 100 biobased plastics may be nonbiodegradable and 100 fossilbased plastics can biodegrade biobased plastics that are not biodegradable include polyethylene terephthalate polyurethanes polyamide polyethylene polyethylenefuranoate or pef is recyclable can be manufactured without fossil fuels and while not biodegradable has the potential to become a more sustainable alternative to the oilbased plastic used to make water bottles celluloses combination of strength and light weight has also attracted interest from the auto industry in the ability to help cars become much lighter and therefore more fuel efficient  its flexible strong transparent nature can also make nanocellulose  an important material in helping bring bendable screens  batteries cosmetics paper pharmaceuticals optical sensors and devices to market the idea of using trees as a source of goods and products in everyday life might sound archaic but in reality weve only just tapped the surface of what the chemicals and materials theyre made of can do markus mannström from finnish renewables company stora enso said recently that we believe that everything made from fossilbased materials today can be made from a tree tomorrow as research advances trees and forests will only play a bigger role in a more sustainable future tags forestry and forest management and arboriculture  forests  technology better forest management 5 june 2018 sustainable bioenergy one of the most interesting outcomes of the recent analysis from the uks forest research fr agency on the carbon impact of biomass cib is the call for regulation to ensure better forest management and appropriate utilisation of materials the research was commissioned by the european climate foundation ecf to follow up frs mighty tome from 2015 of the same name this new piece of work essentially aims to clarify the findings of the initial research with supplementary analysis to address 3 key areas a comparison of scenarios that may give relatively higher or lower ghg reductions  in simple terms providing examples of both good and bad biomass based on the above the report provides a statement of the risks associated with eu bioenergy policy both with and without specific measures to ensure sustainable supply it then goes on to provide a practical set of sustainability criteria to ensure that those bio feedstocks used to meet eu bioenergy goals deliver ghg reductions not surprisingly the report finds that unconstrained and unregulated use of biomass could lead to poor ghg emission results even net emissions rather than removals this again is a nobrainer no reasonably minded person even the most ardent bioenergy advocate would suggest that biomass use should be unconstrained and unregulated there are plenty of obvious scenarios where biomass use would be bad but that doesnt mean that any use of biomass is bad thankfully this analysis takes a balanced view and identifies a number of scenarios where the use of biomass delivers substantial ghg emission reductions the report identifies the use of forest and industrial residues and smallearly thinnings as delivering a significant decrease in ghg emissions this is characterised as good biomass  around 75 of draxs 2017 feedstock falls into these feedstock categories including some waste materials the remainder of draxs 2017 feedstock was made up of low grade roundwood produced as a biproduct of harvesting for sawtimber production this feedstock was not specifically modelled in the analysis but the report concludes that biomass users should strongly favour the supply of forest bioenergy as a byproduct of wood harvesting for the supply of longlived material wood products the low grade roundwood used by drax falls into this category among the more obvious suggested requirements are that biomass should not cause deforestation and that biomass associated with appropriate afforestation should be favoured agreed another interesting recommendation is that biomass should be associated with supply regions where the forest growing stock is being preserved or increased improving growth rates and productivity drax absolutely supports this view and we have talked for some time about the importance of healthy market demand to generate investment in forest management encourage thinning and tree improvement timber markets in the us south have lead to a doubling of the forest inventory over the last 70 years these markets also provide jobs and help communities and ensure that forests stay as forest rather than being converted to other land uses the importance of thinning as a silvicultural tool to improve the quality of the final crop and increase sawtimber production is recognised by forest research this is an import step in accepting that some biomass in the form of small whole trees can be very beneficial for the forest and carbon stock but also in displacing fossil fuel emissions the forest resource of the us south is massive it stretches for more than a thousand miles from the coast of the carolinas to the edge of west texas a forest area of 83 million ha thats more than 3 times the size of the uk given that a wood processing mill typically has a catchment area of around a 4050mile radius imagine the number of markets required for low grade material to service that entire forest resource so what happens when there isnt a market near your forest or the markets close over the last 20 years more than 30 million tonnes of annual demand for low grade timber  thinnings and pulpwood  has been lost from the market in the us south as the paper and board mills struggled after the recession what happens to the forest owner they stop harvesting stop thinning stop managing their forest and that reduces the rate of growth reduces carbon sequestration and reduces the quantity of sawtimber that can be produced in the future recognising that biomass has provided essential markets for forest owners of the us south and directly contributed to better forest management is a really important step the cib report talks about different types of biomass feedstock like stumps which drax does not use conversely the report also identifies good sources of biomass which should be used such as postconsumer waste which drax agrees would be better utilised for energy where possible rather than land fill it also shows that industrial processing residues that would otherwise be wasted and forest residues that would be burnt on site or left to rot would deliver carbon savings when used by facilities like drax all of these criteria are similar to those outlined in the 7 principles of sustainable biomass that drax has suggested should be followed among the other recommendations which echo draxs thinking are that biomass should not use sawtimber or displace material wood markets the scale should be appropriate to the long term sustainable yield potential of the forest  it should be noted that harvesting levels in the us south are currently only at around 57 of the total annual growth counterfactual modelling like that used in this report cannot take account of all realworld variables and must be based on generic assumptions so should not be used in isolation but this report makes a very useful contribution to a complex debate it is possible to broadly define good and bad biomass and to look at fibre baskets like the us south and see a substantial surplus of sustainable wood fibre being harvested a rate far below the sustainable yield potential drax is currently working with the authors of this report and others in the academic world to develop the thinking on forest

industry enviva is the worlds largest wood pellet producer and biggest biomass supplier to drax power station  but in the context of the us forestry industry in which it operates enviva does things differently were leading the industry in sustainability and transparency in our sourcing practices says jennifer jenkins vice president and chief sustainability officer at enviva weve created unique tracking systems and we conduct sciencebased sourcing both of which encourage sound forest stewardship specifically enviva draws on best practices to make decisions about which areas it sources from and how it protects the areas it doesnt protecting bottomland forests a bottomland forest is an area of lowlying marshy area near rivers or streams that can be home to unique tree and wildlife species these forests are flooded periodically and they can be ecologically important however theyre also a part of southeastern americas working forest landscape in fact enviva sources 34 of its wood from these areas  but only where harvesting improves the life of the forest for example in some cases harvesting mimics naturally occurring storms clearing the canopy so young seedlings and forest floor species thrive more than that harvesting can also help keep forests as forests in the areas where we work one of the biggest threats to forests is being converted to another use  specifically to developed or agricultural land explains dr jenkins our goal is to keep forests as forests we want to preserve those with the highest risk of being converted for another use if landowners can gain a steady income from regular harvests theyre likely to keep their land as working forests however this is only true for carefully assessed forests where harvesting is deemed safe any land that doesnt meet envivas set of strict criteria means enviva wont source from it  it can simply walk away the landowners on the other hand dont have that luxury isnt it our responsibility to provide another option for a landowner who might not want to facilitate a harvest asks dr jenkins maybe they recognize its value maybe they would prefer to conserve it instead in recognition of our responsibility we made a commitment a fund that keeps forests as forests envivas commitment was to partner with the us endowment for forestry  communities to set up the enviva forest conservation fund  a 5 million 10year programme designed to protect tens of thousands of acres of sensitive bottomland forests in the virginianorth carolina coastal plain it works by inviting submissions from projects looking to protect areas of high conservation value last year it awarded its first round of funding to four projects more recently in june 2017  the enviva forest conservation fund announced a total of 500000 to go toward a second round of projects with partners such as ducks unlimited  an organization which  with the grant  plans to acquire more than 6000 acres of wetlands to operate as a public wildlife management area the fund follows a history of proactive sustainability programmes including a strict supplier assessment process and the companys track  trace tool  a oneofakind publiclyaccessible system that tracks every ton of primary wood enviva purchases back to the forest from which it was sourced it is entirely transparent and is a testament to envivas commitment to sustainability and doing things differently as dr jenkins explains this approach stems back to the origins of the company in 2004 as a company that makes wood pellets envivas reason for being is to help lower greenhouse

sustainable bioenergy in japanese theres a single word to describe sunlight filtering through the leaves of a tree komorebi its a poetic term to describe an image almost everyone recognises however english has no direct translation but while english lacks a komorebi equivalent it does contain a significant number of words that speak to the very specific features of the forestry industry  terms that describe the crooked nature of a tree open to the elements on a mountain side or words for the process of stripping a grown tree of its limbs here we look at the unusual the uncommon and the whimsical words that make up the language of forestry silviculture seen as both a science and an art silviculture is the practice of controlling the establishment growth composition health and quality of forests this goes beyond just managing working forests for wood products markets however and includes those dedicated to everything from leisure to wildlife comminution one of the first steps in the production of biomass such as wood pellets is reducing down the raw materials like the fresh felled green wood and this relies on a process known as comminution this is carried out by a range of specifically designed machinery such as rotary hammer mills chippers and grinders but can also be done in the forest using mobile chippers to reduce tops and branches krummholz from the german word krumm meaning crooked bent or twisted krummholz is a term for trees that are stunted and sculpted by harsh winds found near the tree line of mountains or on coastlines where there are large quantities of salt in the air exposure to the elements often means these trees are windblown into surreal shapes while branches on one side are often deformed or dead underdog a key component of any sports movie the origins of the word underdog may actually have come from the logging industry in premechanised times logs would be placed over a sawpit and cut up the middle with a long twohandled saw the unfortunate sawyer working at the bottom often knee deep in rainwater under a falling rain of sawdust was known as an underdog however other theories exist which claim the term originates from dog fighting a hypsometer used to measure angles to determine the height of trees hypsometer a hypsometer is a tool used to measure angles when used by foresters it can determine the height of a tree to

can be chipped and sold as biomass brash is not normally removed instead it can be spread along routes used by forestry machinery to prevent ground damage in what are known as brash mats leader the very top stem of a tree this typically develops from a trees terminal bud which is the main area of growth in a plant and is found at the end of a limb foresters using horses and rail carts to transport timber in california 1904 hot logging hot logging is the process of loading logs onto lorries and removing them from forests immediately after felling  when theyre still hot from the saw this is in contrast to the more common process of storing or decking logs on site before removing hot logging is often used when whole tree harvesting as the trees are removed from site and processed at the mill to maximise recovery of high value saw timber material snag dead trees might not seem like the most useful plants in a forest but snags prove otherwise snags are standing dead or dying trees and they serve an important role in forest ecosystems often missing their top or most of their smaller branches snags provide habitats for wide varieties of birds mammals and invertebrates as well as supporting decomposers such as fungi in fresh water environments snags also make essential shelter for fish spawning sites beating up towards the end of the growing season trees that have died shortly after planting are counted and replanted in what is known as beating up this process also allows foresters to identify and address any issues that may have affected growth thinning a staple of responsible forestry thinning is the practice of periodically removing a proportion of trees from a forest to reduce competition and provide the healthiest most valuable trees with greater access to water sunlight and nutrients as well as opening up more resources for the remaining trees this process also provides feedstock for the biomass and paper industries rotation in managed forests foresters keep a range of different age trees to ensure a constant flow of healthy and mature wood rotation is the term for the number of years required between new planting typically of seedlings and final harvesting in the us south rotations of plantation pine are commonly about 25 years and 45 years for naturally regenerated pine while in the uk this is closer to 60 for the same species in even

bioenergy a study on the historical trends in the forest industry of the us south  carried out by supply chain consultancy forest2market and commissioned by drax group the national alliance of forest owners and the us endowment for forestry and communities  found that over the last 60 years as demand for forestry products has increased the productivity of the areas forests has increased too in short the more weve come to use them the more forests have grown a forest is not like a mine  there is not a finite amount of wood in the ground that disappears when it is extracted never to return forests are a renewable resource that can be replanted improved and harvested for as long as the land is managed responsibly whats more landowners have a strong financial incentive to not only maintain their holdings but to improve their productivity  after all the more of something you have the more of it you have to sell it is an economic incentive that works six decades of growth the

and 2015 tree harvests increased by 57 largely driven by us economic growth and increased construction over the same period annual wood growth increased by 112 and inventory increased by 108 in total annual growth exceeded annual removals by 38 on average annual forest growth in the us south increased from 193 million cubic metres in 1953 to 408 million cubic metres in 2015 inventory increased from 4 billion to 84 billion cubic metres the forest products industry funded privatepublic research projects to enhance the quality and performance of seedlings and forest management practices to ensure a stable supply of wood because of these efforts landowners saw the value of active management techniques changing their approach to site preparation fertilization weed control and thinning  and the use of improved planting stock healthy demand made it easy for landowners to take a longterm view investing in more expensive management practices up front for greater returns in the future and the results were extraordinary seedlings established in the last 20 years have helped plantations to become nearly four times as productive as they were 50 years ago a changing market markets for wood have changed over the last two decades precipitated by decreased demand for writing paper and newsprint increased demand for absorbent hygiene products and containerboard and increased demand for biomass these changes in demand have not impacted the way that landowners manage timberland however as sawtimber the largest trees in the forest remains the most valuable timber crop it also remains the crop the landowners want to grow  pulpwood is harvested from the forest only when the forest is being thinned to create optimal conditions for growing sawtimber or when sawtimber is harvested and the forest is being cleared for replanting pellet production has expanded rapidly in the us south though its overall footprint is still small in comparison to more traditional forest product industries in some local wood basins however like the one surrounding bastrop louisiana the location of one of draxs us production facilities the use of biomass to create pellets has filled a gap left by the closure of an 80year old paper mill  draxs decision to locate in this area is integral to supporting forest industry jobs and landowners who carefully consider local demand when deciding whether to continue growing trees according to tracy leslie director of forest2market s biomaterials and sustainability practice as history has shown forests in the us south have benefitted from increased demand for all types of wood the rise of the pulp and paper industry did not detract from landowner objectives to maximize production of higher value sawtimber nor did it result in a shift in focus to growing only pulpwood this new demand did however provide landowners with important interim and supplemental sources of income forest2markets research shows that an increase in demand for pellets will have the same effect incentivizing landowners to grow and regrow forests increasing both forest inventory and carbon storage the real threat to forests not only does demand for forest products increase the productivity and carbon storage of forests and provide an incentive for landowners to continue growing trees but it also helps counter factors that irrevocably destroy this natural resource the real threat to forests in the us is not demand for wood but urbanisation nearly half of all us forestland that converted to another use between 1982 and 2012 was cleared for urban development commercial forestry protects forested lands from development between 1989 and 1999 just 1 of managed pine plantations in the us south were cleared for nonforest development compared to 3 of naturallyregenerated forest types urbanisation not the forest products industry places the most pressure on forests in the us south forest2markets findings demonstrate that demand associated with healthy timber markets promotes the productivity of forests and mitigates forest loss by encouraging landowners to continue to grow harvest and regenerate trees read the full report historical
