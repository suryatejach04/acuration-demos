phones to cars batteries are a power source for many of our everyday belongings and while their beginnings can be traced back to the 19 th century their innovation has transformed industries technology use and society at large today energy storage systems such as pumpedhydropower have long played an important role in balancing electricity systems but as the uk and countries around the world seek to decarbonise industries and make greater use of intermittent renewable sources there is a need for greater levels of storage  while pumpedhydro storage requires the right kind of terrain  batteries can theoretically be built wherever there is the space and investment but what actually is a battery and how does it work turning chemicals to electrical flow batteries are comprised of one or more cells which store chemical energy and are able to convert that energy into electricity in most batteries there are three main components an anode cathode and electrolyte the anode and cathode are terminals for the flow of energy and are typically made of metal the electrolyte is a chemical medium that sits between the terminals allowing an electrical charge to pass through this is often a liquid but increasingly research points to the potential to use solids and create what are known as solidstate batteries how a lithium ion battery works its only when a battery is connected to a device that it completes a circuit and chemical reactions take place that allow the flow of electrical energy from the battery to the device but how much electrical energy a battery can dispense has always been a hurdle to using them as a power source making rechargeable batteries an important breakthrough the same reaction backwards a key element in battery development was the exploration of rechargeable cells these have long provided mobility and reliability in small scale outputs but are now being looked to as a source of largescale energy storage  invented by physician gaston planté in 1859 rechargeable batteries are possible because the chemical reactions that take place are reversible once the initial stored charge has been depleted via chemical reaction these reactions occur again but this time backwards to store a new charge battery charger with aa rechargeable batteries using a leadacid system plantés composition was similar to that found in rechargeable batteries used in cars and motorbikes today although the characteristics of these cells such as their heavy weight meant they were not convenient for many other uses as a result a journey of continuous research and optimisation to decrease the size and weight of rechargeable batteries began this includes investigation into the alternative chemical compositions found in batteries today  nickelmetal hydride and lithiumion to name two recharging in a lowcarbon energy system just as we have seen the size and capacity of batteries bettered throughout history the application and optimisation of modernday lithiumion cells looks to continue too powering the worlds move towards a low carbon renewable energy future from electric vehicle batteries with a million mile lifespan to a 200 megawatt battery farm in south africa  lithiumion allows reasonably largescale energy storage it can also play a key role in power grid stabilisation over short durations of time such as a few hours tesla gigafactory for the uk to run on 100 renewable electricity sources batteries would be imperative in complimenting other flexible renewables such as biomass and hydropower as a support technology batteries can help ensure a continuous supply of electricity to homes and cities even when cloud cover and low wind prevents other sources generating conversely charging and recharging batteries can also be used to absorb and store electricity when there is more sun and wind generation than needed avoiding surges in electric current or wasted generation changing charging woman charging smartphone using wireless charging pad alongside the advancements of battery capacity and composition the way we use them to charge is also changing just as bluetooth and wifi avoid the tethering required of wired connections wireless charging can increase mobility and remove physical limitations smallscale wireless charging is in use today many mobile phones toothbrushes smartwatches and earbuds now have wireless charging pads these use nearfield charging meaning the device must be in close proximity to the charger to receive power however efficient farfield charging is in development with companies like energous and ossia developing overtheair charging solutions for wearable tech medical products smart homes and industrial equipment this would mean devices could be powered and charged from many metres away the implications of this are vast for example your devices could be charged just by entering your home or office there could be less need for invasive surgery to change the batteries for pacemakers neurotransmitters and other implanted medical equipment this type of technology could also provide passive charging for electric vehicles the uk department for transport has announced a trial in nottingham  where charging plates will be placed on parts of the towns roads allowing electric taxis to charge while waiting briefly to pick up passengers as charging technology and speed continues to increase this might mean vehicles could charge wirelessly not only while parked but when stopped at traffic lights 3d rendered illustration of an elderly man with a pace maker as the world shifts away from fossil fuels to renewable sources batteries with continued improvement in performance and capacity will be crucial in supporting our connected lives transport systems and electrical grids tags battery energy storage  decarbonisation  electric vehicles evs what is renewable energy 17 december 2020 sustainable bioenergy these differ to nonrenewable energy sources such as coal oil and natural gas of which there is a finite amount available on earth meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications including electricity generation transportation and heating or cooling the difference between lowcarbon carbon neutral and renewable energy renewables such as wind solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce any carbon dioxide co 2  when they generate power lowcarbon sources might produce some co 2  but much less than fuels like coal bioenergy that uses woody biomass from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow meaning the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains level supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel when its whole lifecycle is considered managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power responsible biomass sourcing also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuelbased energy generation nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable it does not produce co 2 but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium of which there is a finite amount available managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power how much renewable energy is used around the world humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels coal in particular have been the main source of power however as the effects of air pollution and co 2 produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change in the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18 of global electricity generation according to the iea  by 2019 renewable sources made up 27 of the worlds electrical power why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change the single biggest human contribution to climate change is greenhouse gas emissions such as co 2 into the atmosphere they create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on earth to increase making it less habitable renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the worlds demand for power without contributing to global warming unlike carbonintensive fuels like coal gas and oil bioenergy can also be used to remove co 2 from the atmosphere while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same co 2 is captured and stored permanently underground  reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere humans have used renewable energy for millions for years from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs whats holding renewables back the worlds energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind this can make converting national grids difficult and installing new renewable energy sources expensive however as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture build and operate renewable systems the cost of deploying them at scale drops there are future changes needed renewables such as wind solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they cant generate electricity when there is no sun wind or the tidal movement for future energy systems to deliver enough power large scale energy storage as well as other flexible reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and keep systems stable  renewable energy key facts renewable power in the uk has grown sixfold in the last decade helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the countrys electricity system by 58 according to electric insights the cost of electricity from solar panels dropped by 82 between 2010 and 2019 while the cost of onshore wind fell 40 and offshore wind 29 the worlds largest power station of any kind  the three gorges dam in china runs on a renewable energy source hydropower and has a generation capacity of 225 gigawatts gw the total capacity of the worlds installed renewable electricity generation is forecast to reach 3978 gw in 2025 up from 849 gw in 2000 go deeper the magician the prince

companies have laid out plans to become carbon neutral or even carbon negative  as we at drax intend to achieve by 2030  while these leading ambitions are important for the uk and the world to meet the goals of the paris agreement real action polices and investment are needed at scale we have a clearer view of the path ahead than five years ago we know from the recent 6 th carbon budget that renewable energy as well as carbon capture usage and storage ccus are essential for the uk to reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in that detailed 1000page report  the climate change committee ccc was clear that progress must be made immediately  the country as a whole must be 78 of the way there by 2035 by investing where its needed the uk can lead the world in a whole new industry one that may come to define the next century  leading the world in decarbonisation it was a combination of resource and ingenuity that enabled the uk to launch the industrial revolution some 250 years ago today the country is in a similar position of being able to inspire and help transform the world as a country  one that i moved to over 20 years ago now  we have decarbonised at a greater pace than any other over the past decade investing in renewable generation such as wind solar and biomass has allowed the uk to transform its energy systems and set ambitious targets for net zero emissions  to remain resilient and meet the increased electricity demand of the future power grids will require vastly increased support from energy storage systems such as pumped hydro  as well as flexible reliable forms of low and zero carbon power generation however the urgency of climate change means the uk must go beyond decarbonisation to implementing negative emissions technologies which remove more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit the ccc as well as national grids future energy scenarios report have emphasised the necessity of negative emissions for the uk to reach net zero  by removing co 2 not just from energy but other industries too the uk can build on its global leadership in decarbonisation to invest in the cuttingedge green technology that can

powered by only zero carbon generation to support this the electricity system operator is putting in place the systems products and services to enable periods of zero emissions electricity system operation by 2025 achieving a net zero power system will require government to continue its efforts in key policy areas such as carbon pricing which has been central in delivering uk leadership in the move away from coal and has led to uk electricity emissions falling by over 63 between 2012 and 2019 alone it is thanks to successive governments commitment to robust carbon pricing that the uk is now using levels of coal in power generation last seen 250 years ago  before the birth of the steam locomotive a consistent robust carbon price has also unlocked long term investment lowcarbon power generation such that power generated by renewables overtook fossil fuel power generation for the first time in british history in the first quarter of 2020 yet even with the demise of coal and the progress in offshore wind more needs to be done to drive the remaining emissions from electricity as its use is extended across the economy wwwdraxcomukcaptureit in the nearterm in combination with other policies continued robust carbon pricing on electricity will incentivise the continued deployment of low carbon generation market dispatch of upcoming gasfired generation with carbon capture and

match the commitment of the us presidentelects clean energy plan  to ensure the maximum benefit at lowest cost the chosen date should be informed by analysis and consider broad stakeholder input alongside nearterm stability as the uks carbon pricing future is determined to meet this commitment government should launch a consultation on a date for a net zero power system by the budget next

the uk to net zero but they are also innovative projects at scale that can benefit society and the lives of people in the humber and around the uk new jobs in a new sector the humber region has a proud history in heavy industries  what began as a thriving ship building hub has evolved to include chemicals refining and steel manufacturing however these emissionsintensive industries have grown increasingly expensive to operate and many have left for countries where they can be run cheaper leading to a decline in the humber region if they are not decarbonised these industries will face an even greater cost by 2040 emitters could face billions of pounds per year in carbon taxes making them less competitive and less attractive for international investment deploying carbon capture and

levelling up the humber click to view executive summary and case studies from vivid economics report for drax a report by vivid economics commissioned by drax found that carbon capture and hydrogen in the humber could create and support almost 48000 new jobs at the peak of the construction period in 2027 and provide thousands of long term skilled jobs in the following decades as well as protecting peoples livelihoods decarbonisation is also a matter of public health in the humber alone higher air quality could save 148 million in avoided public health costs between 2040 and 2050 i believe the uk is well position to rise to the challenge and lead the world in decarbonisation technology there is a clear opportunity to export knowledge and skills to other countries embarking on their own decarbonisation journeys beccs alone could create many more jobs related to exporting the technology and operational knowhow and deliver additional value for the economy as interest in negative emissions grows around the world the uk needs to move quickly to secure a competitive advantage a fairer economy this is in many ways the start of a new sector in our economy  one that can offer new employment earnings and economic growth it comes at just the right time without intervention to spur a green recovery the covid19 crisis risks subjecting longterm economic damage being at the beginning of the industrial decarbonisation journey means we also have the power to shape this new industry in a way that spreads the benefits across the whole of the uk weve previously seen sector deals struck between the government and industry include equality measures for example the nuclear industry aims to count women as 40 of its employees by 2030 while offshore wind is committed to sourcing 60 of its supply chain from the uk  wind turbines at bridlington east yorkshire at present the humber region receives among the lowest levels of government investment in research and development in the uk contributing to a pronounced skills gap among the workforce in addition almost 60 of construction workers across the wider yorkshire and humber region were furloughed as of august 2020 a project such as zero carbon humber could address this regional imbalance and offer skilled long term jobs to local communities thats why i welcome the prime ministers announcement of 1bn investment to support the establishment of ccus in the humber and other superplaces around the uk as the governments ten point plan says ccus can help decarbonise our most challenging sectors provide low carbon power and a pathway to negative emissions healthier forests the cobenefits of beccs extend beyond our communities in the uk we aim to become carbon negative by 2030 by removing our co 2 emissions from the atmosphere and abating emissions that might still exist on the uks path to net zero this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use continues to be sourced from sustainable forests that positively benefit the environment and the communities in which we and our suppliers operate engineer working in turbine hall drax power station north yorkshire i believe we must continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light we can help ensure the uks biomass sourcing is led by the latest science  best practice and

target very firmly set in their business plans says beckie hart regional director of the yorkshire and the humber cbi confederation of british industry many are high polluters  they know that but they are very keen to became part of the solution developing beccs ccus and hydrogen as well as building the infrastructure needed to capture and transport co 2  offers both immediate construction jobs and longterm skilled jobs the main construction period of the project would run from 2024 to 2031 and support up to 47800 new jobs at its peak in 2027 when 31 billion a year would be added to the regional economy these include up to 25200 high quality jobs in construction and operations as well as a further 24400 supported across the supply chain and wider economy these construction roles include jobs such as welders  pipe fitters  machine installers and technicians  with immediate government backing these jobs could be available in as little as four years ongoing operations will also create 3300 long term skilled jobs in the cluster in the early 2030s the supply chain needed to provide the materials and parts for the regions industrial revitalisation will also support further indirect jobs in fact businesses of all kinds stand to benefit  the increased spending by workers also could support further jobs across businesses ranging from cafes to professional services these indirect jobs go on to induce further employment and spending out across more of the economy overall the report suggests an annual average of more than 7000 indirect and around 10800 induced jobs could be supported during the construction phase with 452 million in indirect and 581 million in induced value added to the wider economy annually on average however transformation is costly and today the humber region receives among the lowest levels of government investment in research and development in the uk this has contributed to a pronounced skills gap in the region as opportunities decline and more people fall out of the workforce bridging the skills gap in the humber projects such as zch depend on availability of skilled workforces to build and operate the next generation of energy technologies however the humber currently has a low proportion of school leavers with the right qualifications to take on roles with specialist technical and practical skills this skills gap is only expected to get worse the governments working futures model forecasts that from 2022 key sectors such as electricity and gas engineering and construction in the region will require higher qualifications than are currently available in the local labour market the skills gap is also compounded by covid19 as it creates economic uncertainty it pushes more people out of work and further reduces skills in the workforce this has a particularly pronounced impact on young people who are less established in careers threatening to create a covidgeneration that feel discouraged and detached from the labour market but this is not an inevitability with the right intervention from government and business the humbers workforce can be upskilled and drive a green recovery a number of different approaches are possible apprenticeships have historically proved a valuable means of training the next generation of workers companies and schools should work together to highlight the opportunities of vocational training to school leavers  universities and colleges must work a lot more closely with the businesses in the region to have an honest conversation about what they need explains hart a good example is the ron dearing university technical college its a businessled college that has only been open about 18 months but has had great results from the students because they offer specific courses that the regions employers actually need for older generations of workers who have been out of the labour force for extended periods of time skills vouchers are a timely intervention these work by offering grants to cover the cost of flexibly retraining meaning longterm unemployed workers of any age can ease back into new types of jobs training local people for the future is key to decarbonising the humber and creating jobs as well as protecting industries but a net zero industrial cluster could also have an impact beyond just the humber carbon removal in yorkshire and the humber the committee on climate change ccc has made it clear that for the uk to reach net zero by 2050 ccus and negative emissions from beccs are essential  as is hydrogen as a zerocarbon source of fuel these will be needed at scale across the uk and in the humber they are already underway engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station drax power station is piloting beccs technology and has proven it can deliver negative emissions generating electricity using biomass from sustainably managed forests that absorb co 2 is a carbon neutral process as part of the power generation process adding ccus and capturing the co 2 emitted storing it permanently under the north sea turns the process into a carbon negative one deploying beccs across four of draxs generating units would support 10304 jobs and create 673 million in value at the peak of the construction phase when operations get underway as early as 2027 750 permanent operations and maintenance jobs could be created drax aims to operate as a carbon negative power station by 2030  of the 10491 jobs supported by deploying beccs 10300 at the peak 6367 of these would be within the projects supply chain and wider economy 9073 in 2028 such supply chains needed across the north of england offer further potential to establish yorkshire and the humber as a hub for decarbonisation technology facilities such as an advanced manufacturing research centre amrc have been proven to make regions of the uk more competitive locations for advanced industries by bringing together business with universities they can focus on sectorspecific challenges for technical industries by creating a manufacturing hub dedicated to research and innovation in a specific industry amrcs also encourage crowingin investments this is when private sectors investments enter into a region in the wake of government spending a zero carbon technologyfocused amrc in the humber would also position the region to offer decarbonisation skills and products to other industrial clusters in the uk and further afield from the humber to the world up the north coast from the humber is net zero teesside a neighbouring industrial cluster with its own aims for decarbonisation through collaboration with clusters such as this zch can offer even wider reaching benefits and enable ukwide carbon capture negative emissions and hydrogen however for the entire uk to reach net zero clusters all across the country must decarbonise  the report suggests as much as 190 million tonnes mt co 2 could be captured and stored every year across the country beyond just the clusters themselves 193000 jobs could be created at the peak for uk deployment in 2039 these jobs would add 139 billion in value to the economy building a strong zero carbon economy based around the combined strengths of beccs ccus and hydrogen can provide the uk with a worldleading export at a time when countries across the globe all face the same decarbonisation challenges successfully building clusters like zch will allow the uk to export knowledge skilled labour technology and services around the world as a port city hull has always had an international influence the chamber of commerce was set up in 1837 by the merchant adventurers who were seafaring traders that history is inbuilt into the local dna says wade today were trying to create the environment for international companies to invest and locate in the humber it serves as a further example of how investing decisively in projects such as carbon capture by drax and ccus and hydrogen clusters such as zero carbon humber today will bring long term economic benefits taking the uk from a green recovery to a worldleading green industrial powerhouse the humber has evolved from the fishing industry to a generator of highemissions products like steel chemicals and power explains hart now it is keen to be the clean corner and teach everyone else how to decarbonise there is a single vision of where we want to go and
