work began to build the iconic cruachan pumped hydro storage power station in scotland its owner drax group has commissioned a new tartan to commemorate the 15 men who died during its construction 23 december 2019 the design based on the clan maccoll tartan sett uses 15 strands of a special dark blue thread to represent those who tragically lost their lives building what was the worlds first reversible pumped storage hydro system located in the western highlands of scotland ian kinnaird head of hydro at drax said building this unique power station was an astonishing feat of engineering completed in challenging conditions the work was physically demanding and at times incredibly dangerous sadly during the course of the construction 15 men lost their lives when we were commissioning this new tartan we decided it was a fitting tribute to incorporate 15 dark blue threads in memory of those who tragically died  many of whom were very young between 1959 and 1965 a 4000strong workforce built the power station on the shore of loch awe in argyll and bute  1300 of them were known as tunnel tigers  the men at the forefront of the work they drilled blasted and cleared the rocks from the inside of the mountain barbara mccabe aged 81 click to viewdownload one of those who died was 23yearold edward gallagher from donegal  the fiancé of barbara mccabe now 81 who lives in invernessshire mrs mccabe explained how she got engaged to edward on december 21 1961 and they were planning to get married the following september however tragedy struck just before easter 1962 when loose rock in the ceiling of a tunnel fell down  the force of which was so strong it pulled edward out of his protective footwear he was such a lovely lovely man mrs mccabe recalled eddies father sent me a telegram and what it said was is eddie alright i didnt know what it meant i was busy getting ready for eddie coming down so we could spend easter together he shouldnt have been at work but hed swapped shifts with someone else who wanted to go home early for easter  that was what eddie was like he was a great young man always doing things like that to help people edward gallagher with barbara at queens park in glasgow 1961 click to viewdownload mrs mccabe explained that mr gallaghers father travelled across from ireland and they went together to the cottage hospital at oban where edward was being treated when i saw eddie there wasnt a mark on his face  but we were told his injuries were so severe there was no hope of survival he passed away in the early hours of easter monday  the 23 rd of april 1962 mrs mccabe has always stayed in touch with mr gallaghers family in donegal and has visited his grave at a chapel in the village of termon near letterkenny of the tartan drax has commissioned she said i think its a lovely way to make sure eddie and the others who died are always remembered ive told his family about it and im going to be sending them one of the new tartan scarves this christmas edward gallagher l february 1962 click to viewdownload hollowing out the ben cruachan mountain was done by handdrilling two to threemetredeep holes into the granite rockface gelignite was packed into the drilled holes and detonated  blasted rocks were then removed by bulldozers trucks and shovels before drilling began on a fresh section of exposed granite eventually some 220000 cubic metres of rubble was removed ian maclean from oban was a 20yearold joiner when he started working at cruachan in 1962 he said i worked as a joiner on the roof of what is the machine hall now the noise from the blasting was incredible  you didnt just hear it you felt it too there was a lot of dust but what bothered us the most was the smell  it was horrible there were fumes from the explosives as well as the dump trucks diesel engines that were running all the time  and we didnt have masks to wear some days the air was so thick you could only see a few yards in front of where you were standing ian maclean looking at the machine hall inside cruachan click to viewdownload in total 20km of tunnels and chambers were excavated including the kilometrelong entrance tunnel and the 91metrelong 36metrehigh machine hall the 77yearold says that despite the conditions he worked in it was an interesting job and he earned good money when i finished as an apprentice joiner i was earning 9 a week  when i started working at cruachan i was on treble that the conditions we were working in were tough  but i met some great people and we were young its just what we did ian kinnard l and ian maclean r inside cruachan click to viewdownload polish and irish labourers worked alongside scots as well as displaced europeans prisoners of the second world war and even workers from as far away as asia the 15 men who died are remembered at cruachan in a mural on the wall of the turbine hall at the heart of the power station and now visitors to the awardwinning hollow mountain visitor centre will see the new tartan waistcoats worn by guides sarah cameron draxs manager of the hollow mountain visitor centre at cruachan added our visitor centre guides will proudly wear the tartan on their waistcoats and continue to tell the stories about how this unique power station was built its important that we remember the 15 men who died and the many others who were injured building this unique power station the new tartan made by kinloch anderson in edinburgh based on the clan maccoll sett which was created in respect of sir edward maccoll the brainchild and pioneer of cruachan power station has also been used to make some special scarves available to buy from the visitor centre shop the hollow mountain visitor centres interactive exhibitions and displays help bring the history of the power station to life and explain how electricity is generated there is also a café gift shop and picnic area the visitor centre is closed now for christmas and the new year  reopening in february

website  drax acquired cruachan power station at the end of 2018 when it bought a portfolio of flexible renewable and lowcarbon power stations located across scotland and england since then the visitor centre has been renovated and drax has also introduced free school tours during term time as part of the companys efforts to boost stem science technology engineering and maths skills 50000 people visit cruachan power station each year and take guided tours inside the subterranean world of the power station where they can see the machine hall and learn about its history and the feat of engineering required to build it cruachan is one of four pumped hydro storage stations in the uk and has a capacity of 440 mw  enough to power more than 90000 homes during peak demand built on the shores of loch awe in argyll and bute it was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on this scale to be built in the world the turbine hall is located 1 km within the hollowedout mountain of ben cruachan and houses four generators supplying a range of vital balancing and ancillary services to the grid such as frequency control spinning and operating reserves helping to maintain secure power supplies draxs scottish operations include hydro facilities in galloway and lanark and a biomassfromwaste plant at daldowie near glasgow along with cruachan all of which were acquired at the end of last year about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2900strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation
