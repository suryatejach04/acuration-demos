drax ørsted sse and sandbag 30 october 2019 power generation rt hon sajid javid mp chancellor of the exchequer hm treasury 1 horse guards road london sw1a 2hq 29 october 2019 dear chancellor need for carbon pricing clarity at the first net zero budget we are writing to you to urge you to maintain the uks robust approach on carbon pricing the prolonged uncertainty regarding the uks carbon pricing future as it exits the eu reiterates the need for the upcoming budget  at whatever final date is chosen  to provide some muchneeded certainty in a potentially turbulent period for businesses across the uk with its approach to carbon pricing the powering past coal alliance and its net zero commitment the uk has been a leader in global efforts to meet the ambition of the paris agreement by phasing out coal as well as incentivising low carbon energy development and helping drive cost reductions this leadership should continue at the first net zero budget as outlined by the committee on climate change in its recent advice to the uk government on its carbon pricing future 1  reaching net zero will require a strong and rising carbon price in order to induce changes to both shortterm behaviour and longerterm investment decisions importantly in the run up to cop26 in glasgow in november 2020 it is important that the uk continues its global leadership and is not perceived to waver on its commitment to tackling climate change given the uncertainty over the uks exit from the eu there is little clarity on what the carbon pricing mechanism will be in the near term and this is already impacting on the forward pricing of carbon in electricity markets therefore providing certainty and stability is crucial when the government sets the carbon price support cps rate for april 2021 and beyond any reduction in cps rates made in isolation of wider clarity on the uks carbon pricing arrangements post eu exit risks sending a negative signal to low carbon investors and undermining the continuing need for a strong and rising carbon price in addition to the considerations on the cps the carbon emissions tax cet  that will replace the eu ets in the event that the uk leaves the eu without a deal  will need to be set out for 2020 as soon as possible to minimise the potential divergence between the cet and the eu ets over 2020 it is vital that the cet is set a level for 2020 that is comparable with recent eu ets pricing we look forward to measures to help the uk meet its leading ambitions at the first net zero budget including certainty and stability on the cps further clarity on the uks carbon pricing future following a successful linking agreement between a uk ets and the eu ets to be in place for 2021 should be provided as soon as is practicable signed drax  ørsted  sse
