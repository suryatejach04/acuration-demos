renewable energy the 8 biggest things in renewable energy 18 july 2018 power generation powering a whole country is a big task the equipment that make up power stations and electricity systems are measured in tonnes and miles and pump gigawatts gw of electricity around the country with the worlds electricity increasingly coming from renewables this big thinking is key to powering longterm change from taller wind turbines to bigger batteries these are the massive structures breaking energy records germanys giant wind turbine and the plan to beat it as wind power becomes ever more prevalent one of the key questions that needs answering is how to get more out of it one way is to build taller turbines and longer blades  putting turbines higher into the air sets them into stronger wind flows while longer blades increase their generating capacity the worlds tallest wind turbines are currently in gaildorf germany and stand at 178 metres with the blades tips reaching 2465 metres  built by max bögl wind ag the onshore turbines house a 34 megawatt mw generator that can produce around 105 gigawatt hours gwh per year however turbines continue to grow and ge has announced plans for the haliadex turbine  which will ship in 2021 at 259 metres in total the offshore turbine is almost double the height of the london eye and will spin 106 metre blades generating 67 gwh per year chinas great wall of solar china has pumped substantial investment into solar power including the worlds biggest solar plant in electricity generation and sheer size dubbed the great wall of solar the tengger desert solar park has a capacity of more than 15 gw and covers 43 km 2 of desert the next largest by comparison is indias kurnool ultra mega solar park which covers just 24 km 2 and generates 1 gw however rampant investment by the country means there are several projects in the pipeline that will break the 2 gw mark and will set new records for solar power plants morocco takes solar to new heights concentrated solar power csp takes the technology skywards by using thousands of mirrors known as heliostats and focusing the suns rays towards a central tower this heats up molten salt within the tower which is then combined with water to create steam and power a turbine  like in a thermal power plant moroccos noor ouarzazate facility pictured in the main photo of this article is home to the worlds tallest csp towers at 250 metres tall 7400 heliostats beam the sunlight at each tower which have a capacity of 150 mw and can store molten salt for 75 hours its record will soon be matched by israels 121 mw ashalim solar thermal power station when it begins operating this year however never one to be outdone when it comes to tall structures dubai plans to build a 260 metre csp tower in 2020 as part of the mohammed bin rashid al maktoum solar park which at 700 mw will be the worlds largest singlesite csp facility three gorges dam chinas monster mountain dam the three gorges dam on chinas yangtza river might be the worlds most powerful hydropower dam with its massive 225 gw capacity but a different chinese dam holds the title of the worlds tallest jinpingi hydropower station is a 305metretall arch dam on the yalong river it sits on the jinping bend where the river wraps around the entire jinping mountain range the project began in 2005 and was completed with the commissioning of a sixth and final generator in 2014 which brought its total capacity to 36 gw itaipu dam and hydropower station brazil and paraguays river arrangement while it may be tall at 568 metreslong jinpingi is far from the longest that mantle belongs to the 7919 metrelong itaipu dam and hydropower station that straddles brazil and paraguay and has an installed capacity of 14 gw the power station is home to 20 700 mw generators however as brazils electricity system runs at 60hz and paraguays at 50hz  10 of the generators run at each frequency  biomass domes that could hide the albert hall using a relatively new material such as compressed wood pellets as a renewable alternative to coal in large thermal power stations creates new challenges  biomass ecostore domes help tackle storage problems by keeping the materials dry and maintaining the right temperatures and conditions unlike cylindrical concrete silos domes also offer greater resistance to hurricanes and extreme weather this is important in areas such as louisiana where this low carbon fuel is stored at the drax biomass port facility in 357 metre high 616 metre diameter domes before it is shipped to drax power station the power station itself is home to four of the worlds largest biomass domes each is 503 metres high and 63 metres in diameter  enough to hold the albert hall or in draxs case 71000 tonnes of biomass  south korean coastline takes the most from the tides beginning operation 1966 the rance tidal power station  in france was the first and largest facility of its kind for 45 years the power station made use of the 750 metrelong rance barrage on frances northern coast with a 330metrelong section of it generating electricity through 24 10 mw turbines it was overtaken however in 2011 with the opening of the sihwa lake tidal power station in south korea the facility generates power along a 400metre section of the 127 km sihwa lake tidal barrage and generates a maximum of 254 mw through ten 254 mw submerged turbines the battle to beat teslas giant battery south australia has become a battlefield in the race to build the worlds biggest grid scale storage solution tesla constructed a 10000 m 2  football pitchsized 100 mw lithiumion battery outside of adelaide at the end of 2017 which is connected to a wind power plant and can independently supply electricity to 30000 homes for an hour however rival billionaire to teslas elon musk sanjeev gupta plans to take on the storage facility with a 140 mw battery to support a new solarpowered steelworks also in south australia the excitement around battery technologys potential means the title of worlds biggest will likely swap hands plenty more times over the next decade this contest wont just be confined to batteries as countries increasingly move away from fossil fuels bigger wider and taller renewable structures will be needed to power the world these are the worlds largest renewable structures today but they probably wont stay in those positions for long tags biomass energy  tidal power  renewable energy  hydroelectric power the companies making coal history 26 june 2018 power generation coal has been the backbone of electricity generation for well over a century  but times have changed a growing understanding of fossil fuels contribution to pollution and global climate change means more energy companies around the world now realise their longterm success depends on moving away from coal as a result between 2015 and last year construction of new coalpowered plants dropped by 73 the powering past coal alliance is an initiative helping facilitate this move it brings together those working moving completely away from coal and is comprised of a number of governments businesses and energy companies  including drax  however it isnt the only initiative of its type  nor is drax the only electricity generator fast moving away from coal here we look at some of the other companies giving coal the cold shoulder avedøre is a high efficiency multifuel combined heat and power plant in denmark operated by ørsted source ørsted ørsted denmarks partly stateowned global energy firm once called dong an acronym for danish oil and natural gas is one of the largest of the alliances members leading the charge away from coal the company is at the forefront of the energy sectors transformation towards renewables it is the global leader in offshore wind having installed more than one quarter of the worlds total offshore wind capacity more recently the company changed its name to ørsted after the danish scientist who first discovered that electric currents create magnetic fields the name change reflects the companys move away from fossil fuels including coal  the company has slashed its coal usage from 62 million tonnes in 2006 to 11 million last year and aims to reach zero by 2023 as well as cutting its co 2 emissions by 96 this is thanks largely to the massive growth in ørsteds offshore wind farm business as well as the conversion of six of ørsteds danish coalfired power stations to biomass the company aims to have enough wind capacity by 2020 to supply 16 million people in europe denver colorado  xcel energys cherokee generating station originally coalfired it is being converted to natural gas xcel energy coal is something of a controversial topic in the us these days however forwardthinking electricity generators in the country are quickly moving from contentious fossil fuels to renewables midwestbased xcel energy is laying out a timeline to switch the majority of its generation from coal to carbonfree sources  the company plans to retire 20 of its coal units between 2005 and 2026  40 of its total coal capacity  and expand its renewable portfolio in its place xcels ambitions are perhaps clearest in colorado where it recently announced it will bring forward the closure of about a third of its coal fleet by a decade  alongside these coal closures the company plans to construct 1131 megawatts mw of new wind capacity 707 mw of new solar power and 275 mw of battery storage in the state nationwide xcel says it is on course to hit a 50 reduction of its 2005 carbon emissions levels by 2022 enel generación chile italian electricity giant enels chilean arm is one of the companies signed up to the chilean governments target of generating 70 of its electricity by renewable sources by 2050 in a positive move towards this the firm recently closed a deal to build 242 mw of new solar wind and geothermal generation  adding to its already growing roster of renewables last year enel green power chile and enap opened the cerro pabellón geothermal plant in the countrys atacama desert located 4500 meters above sea level it is the first facility of its kind in south america and uses chiles volcanic landscape to produce 340 gwh per year it comes as a part of enels wider push to become carbon neutral by 2050  chiles energy ministry and the electricity power generators association have pledged to build no new coal power stations unless they are fitted with carbon capture technology like drax group and the uk companies and countries are quickly moving beyond unabated coalfired power generation tags renewable energy  coal  wind power europes kicking its coal habit 19 april 2018 power generation from roman mines to the fuel behind the continentwide industrial revolution europe has a long history with coal  but with reducing carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions now firmly on the global agenda europes love for coal is rapidly declining collectively the eu aims for renewable sources to account for 20 of gross final energy consumption by 2020 and 27 by 2030  countries in and outside the eu as well as businesses and organisations are setting ambitious targets to phase out coal as part of the uk and canadaled powering past coal alliance which drax recently signed up to  european countries coalfree

and solar generation but also by other lowcarbon energy sources enabling countries to kick their coal habits aiming for 100 renewable as myth after myth is dispelled about renewables  there are countries proving it is possible to power a modern developed nation entirely through renewable energy sources up in the northernmost reaches of europe iceland already generates all its electricity from renewable sources this is split between 75 hydropower and 25 geothermal power  geothermal not only offers a renewable source of electricity but also hot water for heating the volcanic island nation a geothermal power station steams on a cold day in iceland hydropower is also a key contributor to norways renewable ambitions with more than 31 gigawatts gw of installed hydropower capacity norway is able to rely on it as a source of electricity and export its plentiful oil and natural gas reserves to countries still dependent on fossil fuels many parts of europe are well suited to hydropower with reliable rainfall and the mountainous topography necessary to construct dams and power stations parts of austria romania and georgia also make substantial use of hydropower as a source of electricity artificial lake behind the bicaz dam at sunset romania for countries without this access to largescale hydropower its the increased installation of renewables that holds the key to eliminating the need for coal growing renewable generation last year saw electricity generation from renewable sources overtake that from coal for the first time thanks to continuous expansion of wind solar and biomass capacity around the continent between 2010 and 2017 generation from wind solar and biomass installations in eu countries more than doubled from 302 terawatt hours twh to 670 twh according to eurostat  driven primarily by an increase in wind capacity as a source of renewable electricity wind has already proved capable of generating major portions of a countrys demand managing to meet 44 of denmarks overall demand in 2017  this was after previously producing a 40 electricity surplus one day for the country  allowing it to export the emissionfree electricity to neighbours wind turbines on the east coast of sweden across the eu generation from wind more than doubled from 150 twh to 364 twh from 2010 to last year while solar generation grew five times from 23 twh to 119 twh and biomass jumped from 129 twh to 196 twh by contrast coal and lignite fell from 818 twh to 669 twh these renewable electricity sources along with hydropower now account for 30 of eu countries collective electricity generation and while coal generation continues to drop other low carbon energy sources particularly nuclear still play essential roles in many european energy systems from coal to low carbon sweden is one of the leaders in renewable electricity generation setting 2040 as the date to move to totally renewable energy however while it currently counts 65 gw of wind capacity installed and has already exceeded its 2020 renewable generation goals  the countrys 10 nuclear reactors still make up 40 of its electricity output  sweden aims to phasenuclear out of its energy mix but this will force it to import more power from neighbours to meet demand  france is even more dependent with nuclear making up 75 of its electricity production and earning more than 3 billion a year for the country in exports it aims to reduce its nuclear generation to 50 with president emmanuel macron claiming continued nuclear generation offers  the most carbonfree way to produce electricity with renewables  fessenheim nuclear and hydroelectric power plants in alsace france as a reliable and lowcarbon source of electricity the most modern nuclear power stations add a certain amount of flexibility to grids enabling greater adoption of intermittent renewable sources across the eu nuclear made up a quarter of electricity generation in 2017  gas in the transition much more flexible than nuclear gas plays an essential role in many countries it accounted for 19 of electricity generation in the eu last year and produces around half the co 2 and just one tenth of the air pollutants of coal  gas turbines can begin generating electricity at full power in just 30 minutes from a cold start  or 10 minutes from warm standby allowing it to plug any gaps in demand left by intermittent renewables its ability to provide many system services such as reserve power and frequency response will see it play an important transition role over the coming decades until cleaner technologies are able to take over artists impression of a drax rapidresponse gas power station ocgt with planning permission coal is not gone yet making up 11 of eus electricity generation in 2017 but the momentum behind decarbonisation is keeping europe on track to meet its ambitious emissions target and take the final step away from coal tags decarbonisation  renewable energy  investors  gas  coal  wind power going off grid the companies generating their own energy 11 january 2018 power generation the residents of cupertino california are getting used to their new spaceaged neighbour in this silicon valley city a sleek doughnutshaped flying saucer sits on a hillside overlooking the population but this is no extraterrestrial this is the new home of cupertinos mostfamous inhabitant apple the socalled apple campus 2 spaceship has caused a stir since it opened this year with its abundance of trees 100000 squarefoot wellness centre revolutionary chairs and specially designed pizza boxes  it aims to be as the late steve jobs declared it the best office building in the world but theres also something interesting going on outside the building where women and men think up the next iphone around the 175acre campus sits 805000 squarefeet of solar arrays the 17 megawatts mw of solar panels on the spaceships roof and 4 mw of fuel cell storage will provide 75 of the buildings daytime electricity with the rest coming from a nearby 130 mw solar farm the aim is to not only power operations with renewable energy but to do so with selfgenerated renewable energy  and apple arent alone in this endeavour driven by a need to operate more cleanly and enabled by increasingly accessible renewable energy technologies many companies are now pursuing their own energy independence could we soon see the first entirely offgrid multinational going off grid think of ikea and you might think of long afternoons wrestling woodwork and allen keys  what you dont think of is wind turbines however the swedish retailer which boasts 355 locations across 29 countries recently saw the number of wind turbines it owns exceed the number of stores  by 2020 it aims to generate more renewable energy than it uses worldwide  something its already achieved in the nordics and canada  ikea isnt the only retailer exploring innovative energy models us shopping and leisure mall giants target and walmart which count almost 7000 locations between them are also looking to selfgenerate renewable energy at mass scale making use of the space available at their massive stores the retailers are looking to rooftop solar systems to power their efforts to reach 100 renewable energy at the end of last year target was the us leading corporate solar installer with 1475 mw of capacity  followed by walmart with 145 mw unsurprisingly the tech industry is making a big push towards selfsupply or sourcing power from 100 renewable generators this is largely down to just how much electricity they use particularly when it comes to things like data centres estimated by some to become the largest users of electrical power on the planet by the 2020s datacentres house hundreds of rows of servers that remotely store and process internet and mobile data from around the world they are the physical footprint of our digital cloud computing age and already theyre estimated to use roughly 3 of the global electricity supply  one big user of datacentres  crypto currency blockchain  is projected by 2020 to use about the same amount of power each year as denmark  microsoft has tackled its datacentre demand by both developing inhouse generation capabilities and by partnering with local utilities suppliers to source renewable energy for their centres not only does this make operations cleaner but the independence can also increase the reliability of their power supplies which are often backed up by batteries  there are other obvious benefits for companies going energyindependent  one being the pr boost but there is also a significant bottom line benefit even for partly selfgenerating organisations in the first half of 2017 thames water cut 12 million from its annual energy bills by producing 23 of its own electricity while solar and wind made up part of this the water management company generated much of the 146 gwh it produced through biogas made from its own sewage management facilities the power it didnt generate itself was sourced from haven power in the form of renewable biomass electricity what it means for the grid the cynical view may be one that says energy independence is a further step towards entirely independent and unregulated multinationals but there are signs it can benefit the wider population too some selfgeneration operations can feed electricity back into the grid serving as a backup resource at times of high demand this idea of prosuming both producing and consuming electricity is growing outside of big businesses in the residential space  with the rise of electric vehicles and their potential to store and feed power back to the grid it is one likely to grow even further and big companies are taking note microsoft points to its cheyenne wyomingbased data centre as an example of this local utility black hills energy which it has partnered with to source renewable power has the ability to draw from the datacentres normally dormant backup generators in times of need in the uk this is happening on a smaller scale hamerton zoo park in cambridgeshire generates its own onsite wind solar and biomass power making it the most environmentally friendly zoo in europe  excess power not used on site is then sold back to the grid through opus energy  generating extra revenue for the zoo and contributing to overall grid supply even with growing numbers of prosuming and energyindependent companies however there will still be a need for gridstabilising services provided by large scale generators companies perform well when they focus on their core business partnering with energy suppliers to help them manage their electricity  including their selfgenerated power  can make sense but what increasing levels of distributed renewable energy generation offers is the potential to reduce usage of fossil fuels at a countrywide level coordinating the give and take of this energy across the entire system will take significant effort but smart technologies and improving storage will help grids and energyindependent companies work together to make the whole system cleaner tags national grid  renewable energy  energy policy giving up coal tony juniper author adviser and environmental campaigner 7 december 2017 opinion tony juniper is an environmental campaigner author and director at robertsbridge a consultancy helping advise drax on its sustainability programmes back in 2006 while working as director at friends of the earth i approved a new report to be published in support of our then campaign for a new climate change act we wanted to show uk government ministers how it would indeed be possible to make cuts in emissions so that by 2050 the uk could progressively have reduced greenhouse gas pollution by 80 per cent compared with emissions in 1990 it was a radical and demanding agenda that wed adopted and it was important to show the practical steps that could be made in achieving it the analysis we presented was based on an electricity sector model that we had developed different data and assumptions could be inputted and using this we set out six possible lower carbon futures in our best case scenario we foresaw how it would be feasible to slash emissions by about 70 per cent by 2030 this was based on an ambitious energy efficiency programme and a shift away from fossil energy and toward renewables including wind and solar power in that renewables mix was also an important role for biomass to replace coal in the countrys largest power station  drax this was not only crucial for backing up intermittent renewable sources but also a key piece in a future electricity sector that we believed should avoid the construction of new nuclear power stations in november 2008 our campaign succeeded and the uk was the first country in the world to adopt a new national law for the sciencebased reduction of greenhouse gas emissions since then ive been working as an independent sustainability advisor including with the advisory group robertsbridge of which i was a cofounder my work has included assisting various companies in meeting the targets set out in that new law for example i was the chair of the industry campaign action for renewables which sought government and public support for the largescale expansion of wind tidal and wave power different campaigners tried to stop the expansion of these renewable sources of electricity however and succeeded in derailing support for onshore wind power developments although in its infancy concerns were also raised about proposals for different kinds of tidal power in the years after the climate change act i was encouraged to see that drax began to switch over to wood pellets to generate power but concerned to see that this too had come under attack the broadly agreed view that sustainable biomass could have a role in the phase out of coal had gone and in its place were claims that it was actually worse than burning coal it was against this backdrop of changed perspectives that myself and robertsbridge colleagues were pleased to be invited to help drax in devising a new sustainability plan early on in our conversations with drax it became clear that part of the challenge with biomass  deciding the extent to which it is a rational choice to help with the process of decarbonisation is how the answer to that touches so many different issues for example when it comes to the exit from coal cleaner alternatives must be brought forward to replace it including wind and solar power but although these sources of renewable energy are growing rapidly they still come with their own challenges especially because wind cant generate on still days and solar ceases at night this intermittency raises issues about what the best electricity storage or complementary clean power sources might be to back them up when needed there are important questions about the best sources of biomass and the extent to which longdistance transport of that fuel is desirable on top of that are issues linked with the management of the forests from which the raw material is sourced and whether the extraction of wood to generate power can be compatible with carbon neutrality there is the matter of nature conservation and the extent to which wood fuel demand will affect the status of species and habitats of conservation concern for example to what extent might the wood pellet industry be driving the conversion of seminatural woodlands to plantations all of this is bound up with the economic and social conditions prevailing in the landscapes from which the wood is derived and the extent to which those buying wood fuel can pursue positive outcomes for the environment even when carbon and wildlife are at best of marginal concern to the local forest owners growing the wood then there is the extent to which economic incentives might be linked with the carbon stocks held in the forest for example strong demand for wood is held to be the main reason why since the 1950s the volume of carbon stored in standing timber in the forests of the us south has increased by over 100 demand for wood might seem counterintuitive as a positive factor in maintaining tree cover but in the us south it has been a big part of the picture on top of all this is the question of what would happen if there were no demand for wood fuel in landscapes that have seen volatility in demand arising from the decline in newsprint in favour of digital devices and the slowdown in us house building following the 2008 financial crisis this is not easy to answer although seeking answers is a complex task our advice to drax was that it should work with its many stakeholders in finding the best possible fit between its business planning and these and other questions one way of doing that would be to set out the different issues in an accessible manner and hence the production of the film that can be seen here  its called  the biomass sustainability story  and while most of us can agree with the basic idea that we have to stop burning coal it seems the big questions are about what might be the best ways to do it might biomass have a role i believe it does have a look at the film and see what you think especially if you feel as though youve already made up your mind tags renewable energy  climate change  fossil fuels  coal  wood
